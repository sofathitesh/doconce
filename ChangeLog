Version 0.7.1:

* Documentation fixes.

* Removed ipython sphinx extensions in the autogenerated conf.py
  file. Matplotlib has removed these extensions.

* Missing files in @@@CODE are now generated (dummy version).

Version 0.6-0.7:

* Extended hyperref options for latex.

* Improved plain URLs in latex with the \nolinkurl formatting command.

* Dpendence on scitools removed.

* Many improve error messages and warnings. More extensive syntax testing.

* Added functionality for generating LaTeX header and footer by running
  bin/doconce. It is then easy to have a doconce manuscript without TITLE
  and AUTHOR (which implies that the LaTeX version has header and footer)
  and then add a header and footer later whenever needed.

* Added encoding help: doconce guess_encoding and doconce change_encoding
  (Unix and Python ways).

* MOVIE now supports URLs from YouTube, embedded in HTML, rst and sphinx.

* Implemented alignment specifications in tables.

* Added doconce bbl2rst for transforming latex bibliographies to rst syntax.

* Added titlepage as possible latex format (in .p.tex). Added syntax checks.

* Extended doconce sphinx_dir with many options. Copied sphinx themes as
  part of doconce (zip file as package_data). doconce sphinx_dir will now
  automate all steps in making a sphinx document and offer a range of
  different styles/themes.

* Added sphinx doc of API.

* Implemented split of sphinx files: doconce split_rst.

* Major change: format LaTeX -> latex, HTML -> html. Not backward compatibel!

* Added support for links to local .txt, .html and .pdf files.

* bin/doconce: added list_labels and replace_from_file for quick clean up
  of labels in doconce or latex files.

* Reorganized sections in manual.do.txt

* Added extended AUTHOR syntax for including email address.

* Several adjustments of @@@CODE syntax and copying of computer code
  into doconce documents.

* Lowercase html output. Fixed < and > handling in code blocks in html format.

* Added MediaWiki format.

* Introduced BOOK directive in ptex2tex output file (for books in latex).

* Added support of a special exercise format.

* Added automagic treatment of verbatim and underscores inside latex
  figure captions - a big problem since it requires a texttt and a hack.

* Added ipy treatment in sphinx for interactive sessions (different from
  verbatim code blocks).

* Completed sphinxfix_localURLs for reformatting of links to local files.

* Added several math sphinx extensions to bin/doconce generation of conf.py
  files.

* Added pandoc format.

* Added Creole wiki.

* Support for doconce in Python doc strings (.py.do.txt files). Update of tests.

* Added pdflatex format.

* Added bin/doconce grab.

* Added bin/doconce spellcheck

* Added PNG math image generation support via sphinx (fine for PowerPoint
  math directly from doconce source!). Can adjust resolution etc.

* Added solarized and other sphinx themes.
