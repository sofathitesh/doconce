- should check for rst format that comment lines do not appear before !bc and !bt
  easy check: run through lines[i], if lines[i-1].startswith('#') and
  lines[i].startswith('!b'): error in rst
  probably not import for sphinx

- URLs without links:
  work fine for LaTeX and HTML, but not for rst, plain
  strange errors

- epytext: improper paragraph indentation, probably after verbatim
  change with !ec and \n
