% * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
%   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
%   (email-like) text, Wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
%   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
%   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
%   to the formats listed above, and at some later stage eventually go
%   with a particular format?
% 
% * Do you find it problematic that you have the same information
%   scattered around in different documents in different typesetting
%   formats? Would it be a good idea to write things once, in one
%   place, and include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.

\subsection*{The Doconce Concept%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Doconce Concept}%
  \label{the-doconce-concept}%
}

Doconce is two things:
%
\begin{quote}
\newcounter{listcnt0}
\begin{list}{\arabic{listcnt0}.}
{
\usecounter{listcnt0}
\setlength{\rightmargin}{\leftmargin}
}

\item Doconce is a working strategy for documenting software in a single
place and avoiding duplication of information. The slogan is:
``Write once, include anywhere''. This requires that what you write
can be transformed to many different formats for a variety of
documents (manuals, tutorials, books, doc strings, source code
documentation, etc.).

\item Doconce is a simple and minimally tagged markup language that can
be used for the above purpose. That is, the Doconce format look
like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
including HTML, Wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
latter to RTF and MS Word.

\subsection*{What Does Doconce Look Like?%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{What Does Doconce Look Like?}%
  \label{what-does-doconce-look-like}%
}

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,
%
\begin{quote}
%
\begin{itemize}

\item bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,

\item \emph{emphasized words} are surrounded by asterisks,

\item \textbf{words in boldface} are surrounded by underscores,

\item words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
then typeset verbatim,

\item blocks of computer code can easily be included, also from source files,

\item blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included,

\item there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,

\item figures with captions, URLs with links, labels and references
are supported,

\item comments can be inserted throughout the text,

\item a preprocessor (much like the C preprocessor) is integrated so
other documents (files) can be included and large portions of text
can be defined in or out of the text.

\end{itemize}

\end{quote}

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
=====~A~Subsection~with~Sample~Text~=====\\

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

\subsection*{A Subsection with Sample Text%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{A Subsection with Sample Text}%
  \label{a-subsection-with-sample-text}%
}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
\textbf{boldface} words, \emph{emphasized} words, and \texttt{computer} words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
%
\begin{quote}
%
\begin{itemize}

\item item 1

\item item 2

\item item 3

\end{itemize}

\end{quote}

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an \texttt{o}
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:
%
\begin{quote}
\setcounter{listcnt0}{0}
\begin{list}{\arabic{listcnt0}.}
{
\usecounter{listcnt0}
\setlength{\rightmargin}{\leftmargin}
}

\item item 1

\item item 2

\item item 3
\end{list}

\end{quote}

URLs with a link word are possible, as in \href{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}{hpl}.
Just a file link goes like \url{tutorial.do.txt}. References
to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a ``label'' command right
after the section title), as in the reference to
the chapter ref\{my:first:sec\}.

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

\leavevmode

\subsection*{Mathematics and Computer Code%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Mathematics and Computer Code}%
  \label{mathematics-and-computer-code}%
}

Inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x),
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
\$\textbackslash{}nu~=~\textbackslash{}sin(x)\$|\$v~=~sin(x)\$
}
\end{quote}

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
\texttt{!bt} and \texttt{!et} (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
\textbackslash{}begin\{eqnarray\}\\
\{\textbackslash{}partial~u\textbackslash{}over\textbackslash{}partial~t\}~\&=\&~\textbackslash{}nabla\textasciicircum{}2~u~+~f,\textbackslash{}label\{myeq1\}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}\\
\{\textbackslash{}partial~v\textbackslash{}over\textbackslash{}partial~t\}~\&=\&~\textbackslash{}nabla\textbackslash{}cdot(q(u)\textbackslash{}nabla~v)~+~g\\
\textbackslash{}end\{eqnarray\}
}
\end{quote}

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
\texttt{!bc} and \texttt{!ec} instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
from~math~import~sin,~pi\\
def~myfunc(x):\\
~~~~return~sin(pi*x)\\
~\\
import~integrate\\
I~=~integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc,~0,~pi,~100)
}
\end{quote}

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!).

Another document can be included by writing \texttt{\#include "mynote.do.txt"}
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension \texttt{do.txt}. The \texttt{do} part stands for doconce, while the
trailing \texttt{.txt} denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.

\subsection*{Macros (Newcommands)%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Macros (Newcommands)}%
  \label{macros-newcommands}%
}

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style \emph{newcommand}
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
\texttt{newcommand\_replace.tex} are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names \texttt{newcommands.tex} and
\texttt{newcommands\_keep.tex} are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
\texttt{!bt} and \texttt{!et} in \texttt{newcommands\_keep.tex} to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
\texttt{newcommands\_replace.tex} and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the \texttt{newcommands*.tex} files \emph{must} appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

% Example on including another Doconce file:

\section*{From Doconce to Other Formats%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{From Doconce to Other Formats}%
  \label{from-doconce-to-other-formats}%
}

Transformation of a Doconce document to various other
formats applies the script \texttt{doconce2format}:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~doconce2format~format~mydoc.do.txt
}
\end{quote}

The \texttt{preprocess} program is always used to preprocess the file first,
and options to \texttt{preprocess} can be added after the filename. For example:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~doconce2format~LaTeX~mydoc.do.txt~-Dextra\_sections
}
\end{quote}

The variable \texttt{FORMAT} is always defined as the current format when
running \texttt{preprocess}. That is, in the last example, \texttt{FORMAT} is
defined as \texttt{LaTeX}. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like \texttt{\#if FORMAT == "LaTeX"}.


%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection*{HTML%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{HTML}%
  \label{html}%
}

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file \texttt{mydoc.do.txt}
is performed by:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~doconce2format~HTML~mydoc.do.txt
}
\end{quote}

The resulting file \texttt{mydoc.html} can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.


%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection*{LaTeX%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{LaTeX}%
  \label{latex}%
}

Making a LaTeX file \texttt{mydoc.tex} from \texttt{mydoc.do.txt} is done in two steps:
.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many
.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph
.. environment, as used here.
%
\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Step 1.} Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form \texttt{mydoc.p.tex} for}] \leavevmode 
\texttt{ptex2tex}:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~doconce2format~LaTeX~mydoc.do.txt
}
\end{quote}

\end{description}

LaTeX-specific commands (``newcommands'') in math formulas and similar
can be placed in a file \texttt{newcommands.tex}. If this file is present,
it is included in the LaTeX document so that your commands are
defined.

\emph{Step 2.} Run \texttt{ptex2tex} (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~ptex2tex~mydoc
}
\end{quote}

or just perform a plain copy:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~cp~mydoc.p.tex~mydoc.tex
}
\end{quote}

The \texttt{ptex2tex} tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents.
Finally, compile \texttt{mydoc.tex} the usual way and create the PDF file.


%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection*{Plain ASCII Text%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Plain ASCII Text}%
  \label{plain-ascii-text}%
}

We can go from Doconce ``back to'' plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~doconce2format~plain~mydoc.do.txt~~\#~results~in~mydoc.txt
}
\end{quote}


%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection*{reStructuredText%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{reStructuredText}%
  \label{restructuredtext}%
}

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file \texttt{mydoc.rst}:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~doconce2format~rst~mydoc.do.txt
}
\end{quote}

We may now produce various other formats:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~rst2html.py~~mydoc.rst~>~mydoc.html~\#~HTML\\
Unix/DOS>~rst2latex.py~mydoc.rst~>~mydoc.tex~~\#~LaTeX\\
Unix/DOS>~rst2xml.py~~~mydoc.rst~>~mydoc.xml~~\#~XML\\
Unix/DOS>~rst2odt.py~~~mydoc.rst~>~mydoc.odt~~\#~OpenOffice
}
\end{quote}

The OpenOffice file \texttt{mydoc.odt} can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.


%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection*{Sphinx%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Sphinx}%
  \label{sphinx}%
}

Sphinx documents can be created from a Doconce source in a few steps.

\emph{Step 1.} Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~doconce2format~sphinx~mydoc.do.txt
}
\end{quote}

\emph{Step 2.} Create a Sphinx root directory with a \texttt{conf.py} file,
either manually or by using the interactive \texttt{sphinx-quickstart}
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
mkdir~sphinx-rootdir\\
sphinx-quickstart~<{}<EOF\\
sphinx-rootdir\\
n\\
\_\\
Name~of~My~Sphinx~Document\\
Author\\
version\\
version\\
.rst\\
index\\
n\\
y\\
n\\
n\\
n\\
n\\
y\\
n\\
n\\
y\\
y\\
y\\
EOF
}
\end{quote}

\emph{Step 3.} Move the \texttt{tutorial.rst} file to the Sphinx root directory:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~mv~mydoc.rst~sphinx-rootdir
}
\end{quote}

\emph{Step 4.} Edit the generated \texttt{index.rst} file so that \texttt{mydoc.rst}
is included, i.e., add \texttt{mydoc} to the \texttt{toctree} section so that it becomes:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
..~toctree::\\
~~~:maxdepth:~2\\
~\\
~~~mydoc
}
\end{quote}

(The spaces before \texttt{mydoc} are important!)

\emph{Step 5.} Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
make~clean~~~\#~remove~old~versions\\
make~html
}
\end{quote}

Many other formats are also possible.

\emph{Step 6.} View the result:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~firefox~\_build/html/index.html
}
\end{quote}


%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsection*{Google Code Wiki%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Google Code Wiki}%
  \label{google-code-wiki}%
}

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by \href{http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax}{Google Code}.
The transformation to this format, called \texttt{gwiki} to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
Unix/DOS>~doconce2format~gwiki~mydoc.do.txt
}
\end{quote}

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the \texttt{mydoc.gwiki} output file from \texttt{doconce2format} and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press \textbf{Preview} or \textbf{Save Page} to
see the formatted result.

\subsubsection*{Demos%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Demos}%
  \label{demos}%
}

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
}
\end{quote}

The file \texttt{make.sh} in the \texttt{tutorial} directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, \texttt{tutorial.do.txt} is the
starting point.  Running \texttt{make.sh} and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original \texttt{tutorial.do.txt} file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
\href{https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/trunk/docs/demo/index.html}{Here} is a sample
of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the \texttt{docs/manual} directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, \texttt{manual.do.txt}, to
various formats. The \texttt{make.sh} script runs a set of translations.


%___________________________________________________________________________

\subsubsection*{Dependencies%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Dependencies}%
  \label{dependencies}%
}

Doconce needs the Python packages
\href{http://docutils.sourceforge.net}{docutils},
\href{http://code.google.com/p/preprocess}{preprocess}, and
\href{http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex}{ptex2tex}. The latter is only
needed for the LaTeX formats.

\subsection*{The Doconce Documentation Strategy for User Manuals%
  \phantomsection%
  \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Doconce Documentation Strategy for User Manuals}%
  \label{the-doconce-documentation-strategy-for-user-manuals}%
}

Doconce was particularly made for writing tutorials or user manuals
associated with computer codes. The text is written in Doconce format
in separate files. LaTeX, HTML, XML, and other versions of the text
is easily produced by the \texttt{doconce2format} script and standard tools.
A plain text version is often wanted for the computer source code,
this is easy to make, and then one can use
\texttt{\#include} statements in the computer source code to automatically
get the manual or tutorial text in comments or doc strings.
Below is a worked example.

Consider an example involving a Python module in a \texttt{basename.p.py} file.
The \texttt{.p.py} extension identifies this as a file that has to be
preprocessed) by the \texttt{preprocess} program.
In a doc string in \texttt{basename.p.py} we do a preprocessor include
in a comment line, say:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
\#~~~~\#include~"docstrings/doc1.dst.txt
}
\end{quote}

% Note: we insert an error right above as the right quote is missing.

% Then preprocess skips the statement, otherwise it gives an error

% message about a missing file docstrings/doc1.dst.txt (which we don't

% have, it's just a sample file name). Also note that comment lines

% must not come before a code block for the rst/st/epytext formats to work.

The file \texttt{docstrings/doc1.dst.txt} is a file filtered to a specific format
(typically plain text, reStructedText, or Epytext) from an original
``singleton'' documentation file named \texttt{docstrings/doc1.do.txt}. The \texttt{.dst.txt}
is the extension of a file filtered ready for being included in a doc
string (\texttt{d} for doc, \texttt{st} for string).

For making an Epydoc manual, the \texttt{docstrings/doc1.do.txt} file is
filtered to \texttt{docstrings/doc1.epytext} and renamed to
\texttt{docstrings/doc1.dst.txt}.  Then we run the preprocessor on the
\texttt{basename.p.py} file and create a real Python file
\texttt{basename.py}. Finally, we run Epydoc on this file. Alternatively, and
nowadays preferably, we use Sphinx for API documentation and then the
Doconce \texttt{docstrings/doc1.do.txt} file is filtered to
\texttt{docstrings/doc1.rst} and renamed to \texttt{docstrings/doc1.dst.txt}. A
Sphinx directory must have been made with the right \texttt{index.rst} and
\texttt{conf.py} files. Going to this directory and typing \texttt{make html} makes
the HTML version of the Sphinx API documentation.

The next step is to produce the final pure Python source code. For
this purpose we filter \texttt{docstrings/doc1.do.txt} to plain text format
(\texttt{docstrings/doc1.txt}) and rename to \texttt{docstrings/doc1.dst.txt}. The
preprocessor transforms the \texttt{basename.p.py} file to a standard Python
file \texttt{basename.py}. The doc strings are now in plain text and well
suited for Pydoc or reading by humans. All these steps are automated
by the \texttt{insertdocstr.py} script.  Here are the corresponding Unix
commands:
%
\begin{quote}{\ttfamily \raggedright \noindent
\#~make~Epydoc~API~manual~of~basename~module:\\

}

Doconce can be viewed is a unified interface to a variety of
typesetting formats.  This interface is minimal in the sense that a
lot of typesetting features are not supported, for example, footnotes
and bibliography. For many documents the simple Doconce format is
sufficient, while in other cases you need more sophisticated
formats. Then you can just filter the Doconce text to a more
approprite format and continue working in this format only.  For
example, reStructuredText is a good alternative: it is more tagged
than Doconce and cannot be filtered to plain, untagged text, or wiki,
and the LaTeX output is not at all as clean, but it also has a lot
more typesetting and tagging features than Doconce.
