* When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
  to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
  (email-like) text, Wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
  reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
  start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
  to the formats listed above, and at some later stage eventually go
  with a particular format?

* Do you find it problematic that you have the same information
  scattered around in different documents in different typesetting
  formats? Would it be a good idea to write things once, in one
  place, and include it anywhere?</comment><paragraph>If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.</paragraph></section><section ids="the-doconce-concept" names="the\ doconce\ concept"><title>The Doconce Concept</title><paragraph>Doconce is two things:</paragraph><block_quote><enumerated_list enumtype="arabic" prefix="" suffix="."><list_item><paragraph>Doconce is a working strategy for documenting software in a single
place and avoiding duplication of information. The slogan is:
&quot;Write once, include anywhere&quot;. This requires that what you write
can be transformed to many different formats for a variety of
documents (manuals, tutorials, books, doc strings, source code
documentation, etc.).</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce is a simple and minimally tagged markup language that can
be used for the above purpose. That is, the Doconce format look
like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
including HTML, Wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
latter to RTF and MS Word.</paragraph></list_item></enumerated_list></block_quote><paragraph>Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:</paragraph><block_quote><bullet_list bullet="*"><list_item><paragraph>Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in http://folk.uio.no/hpl&lt;hpl&gt;.
Just a file link goes like URL:&quot;tutorial.do.txt&quot;. References
to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a &quot;label&quot; command right
after the section title), as in the reference to
Chapter ref{my:first:sec}.

allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$</literal_block><paragraph>The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.</paragraph><paragraph>Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
<literal>!bt</literal> and <literal>!et</literal> (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &amp;=&amp; \nabla^2 u + f,\label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &amp;=&amp; \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{eqnarray}</literal_block><paragraph>Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).</paragraph><paragraph>You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
<literal>!bc</literal> and <literal>!ec</literal> instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)</literal_block><paragraph>One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!).</paragraph><paragraph>Another document can be included by writing <literal>#include &quot;mynote.do.txt&quot;</literal>
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension <literal>do.txt</literal>. The <literal>do</literal> part stands for doconce, while the
trailing <literal>.txt</literal> denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.</paragraph></section><section ids="macros-newcommands-cross-references-index-and-bibliography" names="macros\ (newcommands),\ cross-references,\ index,\ and\ bibliography"><title>Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography</title><paragraph>Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style <emphasis>newcommand</emphasis>
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
<literal>newcommand_replace.tex</literal> are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names <literal>newcommands.tex</literal> and
<literal>newcommands_keep.tex</literal> are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
<literal>!bt</literal> and <literal>!et</literal> in <literal>newcommands_keep.tex</literal> to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
<literal>newcommands_replace.tex</literal> and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the <literal>newcommands*.tex</literal> files <emphasis>must</emphasis> appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).</paragraph><paragraph>Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically
one can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or
in equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index
can be defined, and citations to literature, with an accompanying
bibliography in a file, are also supported features. The syntax
of labels, references, citations, and the bibliography closely resembles
that of LaTeX, and Doconce documents therefore integrate well as parts
of large LaTeX documents. For further details on functionality and syntax
we refer to the <literal>docs/manual/manual.do.txt</literal> file

associated with computer codes. The text is written in Doconce format
in separate files. LaTeX, HTML, XML, and other versions of the text
is easily produced by the <literal>doconce2format</literal> script and standard tools.
A plain text version is often wanted for the computer source code,
this is easy to make, and then one can use
<literal>#include</literal> statements in the computer source code to automatically
get the manual or tutorial text in comments or doc strings.
Below is a worked example.</paragraph><paragraph>Consider an example involving a Python module in a <literal>basename.p.py</literal> file.
The <literal>.p.py</literal> extension identifies this as a file that has to be
preprocessed) by the <literal>preprocess</literal> program.
In a doc string in <literal>basename.p.py</literal> we do a preprocessor include
in a comment line, say:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">#    #include &quot;docstrings/doc1.dst.txt</literal_block><comment xml:space="preserve">Note: we insert an error right above as the right quote is missing.</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">Then preprocess skips the statement, otherwise it gives an error</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">message about a missing file docstrings/doc1.dst.txt (which we don't</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">have, it's just a sample file name). Also note that comment lines</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">must not come before a code block for the rst/st/epytext formats to work.</comment><paragraph>The file <literal>docstrings/doc1.dst.txt</literal> is a file filtered to a specific format
(typically plain text, reStructedText, or Epytext) from an original
&quot;singleton&quot; documentation file named <literal>docstrings/doc1.do.txt</literal>. The <literal>.dst.txt</literal>
is the extension of a file filtered ready for being included in a doc
string (<literal>d</literal> for doc, <literal>st</literal> for string).</paragraph><paragraph>For making an Epydoc manual, the <literal>docstrings/doc1.do.txt</literal> file is
filtered to <literal>docstrings/doc1.epytext</literal> and renamed to
<literal>docstrings/doc1.dst.txt</literal>.  Then we run the preprocessor on the
<literal>basename.p.py</literal> file and create a real Python file
<literal>basename.py</literal>. Finally, we run Epydoc on this file. Alternatively, and
nowadays preferably, we use Sphinx for API documentation and then the
Doconce <literal>docstrings/doc1.do.txt</literal> file is filtered to
<literal>docstrings/doc1.rst</literal> and renamed to <literal>docstrings/doc1.dst.txt</literal>. A
Sphinx directory must have been made with the right <literal>index.rst</literal> and
<literal>conf.py</literal> files. Going to this directory and typing <literal>make html</literal> makes
the HTML version of the Sphinx API documentation.</paragraph><paragraph>The next step is to produce the final pure Python source code. For
this purpose we filter <literal>docstrings/doc1.do.txt</literal> to plain text format
(<literal>docstrings/doc1.txt</literal>) and rename to <literal>docstrings/doc1.dst.txt</literal>. The
preprocessor transforms the <literal>basename.p.py</literal> file to a standard Python
file <literal>basename.py</literal>. The doc strings are now in plain text and well
suited for Pydoc or reading by humans. All these steps are automated
by the <literal>insertdocstr.py</literal> script.  Here are the corresponding Unix
commands:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve"># make Epydoc API manual of basename module:
cd docstrings
doconce2format epytext doc1.do.txt
mv doc1.epytext doc1.dst.txt

# make Sphinx API manual of basename module:

# can automate inserting doc strings in all .p.py files:
insertdocstr.py plain .
# (runs through all .do.txt files and filters them to plain format and
# renames to .dst.txt extension, then the script runs through all
# .p.py files and runs the preprocessor, which includes the .dst.txt
# files)</literal_block></section></section><section ids="warning-disclaimer" names="warning/disclaimer"><title>Warning/Disclaimer</title><paragraph>Doconce can be viewed is a unified interface to a variety of
typesetting formats.  This interface is minimal in the sense that a
lot of typesetting features are not supported, for example, footnotes
and bibliography. For many documents the simple Doconce format is
sufficient, while in other cases you need more sophisticated
formats. Then you can just filter the Doconce text to a more
approprite format and continue working in this format only.  For
example, reStructuredText is a good alternative: it is more tagged
than Doconce and cannot be filtered to plain, untagged text, or wiki,
and the LaTeX output is not at all as clean, but it also has a lot
more typesetting and tagging features than Doconce.</paragraph></section></document>
