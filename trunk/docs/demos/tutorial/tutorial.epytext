TITLE: Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Simula Research Laboratory, and University of Oslo)DATE: September 10, 2010


 - When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, Wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and at some later stage eventually go
   with a particular format?
 - Do you find it problematic that you have the same information
   scattered around in different documents in different typesetting
   formats? Would it be a good idea to write things once, in one
   place, and include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


The Doconce Concept
===================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a working strategy for documenting software in a single
    place and avoiding duplication of information. The slogan is:
    "Write once, include anywhere". This requires that what you write
    can be transformed to many different formats for a variety of
    documents (manuals, tutorials, books, doc strings, source code
    documentation, etc.).
 2. Doconce is a simple and minimally tagged markup language that can
    be used for the above purpose. That is, the Doconce format look
    like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  - Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, or MS Word.
  - Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    googlecode.com, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a master's thesis.
  - Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    MS Word documents or in wikis.

What Does Doconce Look Like?
============================

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,

  - bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,
  - I{emphasized words} are surrounded by asterisks, 
  - B{words in boldface} are surrounded by underscores, 
  - words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and 
    then typeset verbatim,
  - blocks of computer code can easily be included, also from source files,
  - blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included,
  - there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,
  - figures with captions, URLs with links, labels and references
    are supported,
  - comments can be inserted throughout the text,
  - a preprocessor (much like the C preprocessor) is integrated so
    other documents (files) can be included and large portions of text
    can be defined in or out of the text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format::


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Chapter ref{my:first:sec}. 
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Chapter ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
B{boldface} words, I{emphasized} words, and C{computer} words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an C{o}
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1
 2. item 2
 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in U{tutorial.do.txt<tutorial.do.txt>}.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the chapter "A Subsection with Sample Text". 

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
2.0           1.376512      11.919        
4.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     
============  ============  ============  


Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as M{v = sin(x)},
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like M{v = sin(x)} is
typeset as::


            
            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
C{!bt} and C{!et} (begin tex / end tex) instructions. 
The result looks like this::

            
            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
C{!bc} and C{!ec} instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like::


        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

It is possible to add a specification of a (ptex2tex-style)
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., C{!bc xxx}
where C{xxx} is an identifier like C{pycod} for code snippet in Python,
C{sys} for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ptex2tex and defined in a
configuration file C{.ptext2tex.cfg}, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments)::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, C{pro} and C{cod} are C{python}, C{sys} is C{console},
while C{xpro} and C{xcod} are computer language specific for C{x}
in C{f} (Fortran), C{c} (C), C{cpp} (C++), and C{py} (Python).


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset 
with C{!bc pro}, while a part of a file is copied into a C{!bc cod}
environment. What C{pro} and C{cod} mean is then defined through
a C{.ptex2tex.cfg} file for LaTeX and a C{sphinx code-blocks}
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing C{#include "mynote.do.txt"}
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension C{do.txt}. The C{do} part stands for doconce, while the
trailing C{.txt} denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style I{newcommand}
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
C{newcommand_replace.tex} are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names C{newcommands.tex} and
C{newcommands_keep.tex} are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
C{!bt} and C{!et} in C{newcommands_keep.tex} to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
C{newcommands_replace.tex} and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the C{newcommands*.tex} files I{must} appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the C{docs/manual/manual.do.txt} file (see the
U{demo
page<https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/trunk/docs/demos/manual/index.html>} for various formats of this document).




From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document to various other
formats applies the script C{doconce2format}:
!bc   sys
        Unix/DOS> doconce2format format mydoc.do.txt

The C{preprocess} program is always used to preprocess the file first,
and options to C{preprocess} can be added after the filename. For example::


        Unix/DOS> doconce2format LaTeX mydoc.do.txt -Dextra_sections

The variable C{FORMAT} is always defined as the current format when
running C{preprocess}. That is, in the last example, C{FORMAT} is
defined as C{LaTeX}. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like C{#if FORMAT == "LaTeX"}.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Unix/DOS> doconce2format LaTeX mydoc.do.txt remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running a helper script in the C{bin} folder of the Doconce
source code::


        Unix/DOS> doconce_remove_inline_comments.py mydoc.do.txt

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file C{mydoc.do.txt}
is performed by::


        Unix/DOS> doconce2format HTML mydoc.do.txt

The resulting file C{mydoc.html} can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file C{mydoc.tex} from C{mydoc.do.txt} is done in two steps:

I{Step 1.} Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form C{mydoc.p.tex} for
     C{ptex2tex}:
!bc   sys
        Unix/DOS> doconce2format LaTeX mydoc.do.txt

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files C{newcommands.tex}, C{newcommands_keep.tex}, or
C{newcommands_replace.tex} (see the section "Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography"). 
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document 
so that your commands are defined.

I{Step 2.} Run C{ptex2tex} (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Unix/DOS> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy::


        Unix/DOS> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a C{.p.tex} file with some preprocessor macros.
For example, to enable font Helvetica instead of the standard
Computer Modern font::


        Unix/DOS> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. The standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through::


        Unix/DOS> ptex2tex -DTRAD_LATEX_HEADING mydoc


The C{ptex2tex} tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any C{!bc sys} command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your C{.ptex2tex.cfg}
file, e.g., C{!bc sys cod} for a code snippet, where C{cod} is set to
a certain environment in C{.ptex2tex.cfg} (e.g., C{CodeIntended}).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

I{Step 3.} Compile C{mydoc.tex}
and create the PDF file::


        Unix/DOS> latex mydoc
        Unix/DOS> latex mydoc
        Unix/DOS> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Unix/DOS> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Unix/DOS> latex mydoc
        Unix/DOS> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the C{Minted_Python}, C{Minted_Cpp}, etc., environments
in C{ptex2tex} for typesetting code, the C{minted} LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running C{doconce2format} with the
C{-DMINTED} option::


        Unix/DOS> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, C{latex} must be run with the
C{-shell-escape} option::


        Unix/DOS> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Unix/DOS> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Unix/DOS> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Unix/DOS> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Unix/DOS> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Unix/DOS> dvipdf mydoc

The C{-shell-escape} option is required because the C{minted.sty} style
file runs the C{pygments} program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from C{latex} without the C{-shell-escape} option.


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Unix/DOS> doconce2format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file C{mydoc.rst}:
!bc   sys
        Unix/DOS> doconce2format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Unix/DOS> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # HTML
        Unix/DOS> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # LaTeX
        Unix/DOS> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Unix/DOS> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file C{mydoc.odt} can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents can be created from a Doconce source in a few steps.

I{Step 1.} Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format::


        Unix/DOS> doconce2format sphinx mydoc.do.txt


I{Step 2.} Create a Sphinx root directory with a C{conf.py} file, 
either manually or by using the interactive C{sphinx-quickstart}
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


I{Step 3.} Move the C{tutorial.rst} file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Unix/DOS> mv mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with C{mydoc.rst} in the C{sphinx-rootdir}
directory. Either edit C{mydoc.rst} so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directory to C{sphinx-rootdir} (if all figures
are located in a subdirectory).

I{Step 4.} Edit the generated C{index.rst} file so that C{mydoc.rst}
is included, i.e., add C{mydoc} to the C{toctree} section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before C{mydoc} are important!)

I{Step 5.} Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html

Many other formats are also possible.

I{Step 6.} View the result::


        Unix/DOS> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows C{!bc}: C{cod} gives Python
(C{code-block:: python} in Sphinx syntax) and C{cppcod} gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.



Google Code Wiki
----------------

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by U{Google Code<http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>}.
The transformation to this format, called C{gwiki} to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by::


        Unix/DOS> doconce2format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the C{mydoc.gwiki} output file from C{doconce2format} and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press B{Preview} or B{Save Page} to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
C{.rst} file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if C{.eps} or C{.png} is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The C{make.sh} files in C{docs/manual} and C{docs/tutorial} 
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file C{make.sh} in the C{tutorial} directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, C{tutorial.do.txt} is the
starting point.  Running C{make.sh} and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original C{tutorial.do.txt} file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
U{Here<https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/trunk/docs/demos/tutorial/index.html>} 
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the C{docs/manual} directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, C{manual.do.txt}, to
various formats. The C{make.sh} script runs a set of translations.

Dependencies
------------

Doconce depends on the Python package
U{preprocess<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess/>}.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need U{ptex2tex<http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>} and some style files
that ptex2tex potentially makes use of.  Going from reStructuredText
to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX requires
U{docutils<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>}.  Making Sphinx documents
requires of course U{sphinx<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>}.


Warning/Disclaimer
==================

Doconce can be viewed is a unified interface to a variety of
typesetting formats.  This interface is minimal in the sense that a
lot of typesetting features are not supported, for example, footnotes
and bibliography. For many documents the simple Doconce format is
sufficient, while in other cases you need more sophisticated
formats. Then you can just filter the Doconce text to a more
approprite format and continue working in this format only.  For
example, reStructuredText is a good alternative: it is more tagged
than Doconce and cannot be filtered to plain, untagged text, or wiki,
and the LaTeX output is not at all as clean, but it also has a lot
more typesetting and tagging features than Doconce.
