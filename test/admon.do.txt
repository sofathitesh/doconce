TITLE: Testing admons
AUTHOR: hpl
DATE: today

First some ordinary text to compare font sizes in admonitions
and the surrounding text.

# #if FORMAT == "sphinx"
Note that `automake_sphinx.py` fixes the HTML file generated by Sphinx
so that all styles for admonitions have a colored background.
# #endif

!bwarning
And here is a warning about something to pay attention to. We
test how the heading behave and add quite some extra texts
in comparison with the other admons.

  * and a list
  * with items
!ewarning

Here goes some more text before a "notice" admonition where we control
the title.

# Note that the final ! does not appear in Sphinx and reST since
# those formats automatically add : to the admonition title.

!bnotice Note, eventually!
Ah, we are close to the end.
With math:
!bt
\[ p=q\]
!et
!enotice

!bquestion
So, how many admonition environments does Doconce support?
!equestion

!bhint
It is smart to read on and remember to

 o stay cool
 o read hints carefully

Also, remember

!bc pycod
import urllib

def grab(url, filename):
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=filename)
!ec
!ehint

A bit of text before the summary, which we now call "Concluding remarks,
for the novice",
because we can.

!bsummary Concluding remarks, for the novice
We can summarize the most important things with admons: they have
a different typesetting, and they may have a symbol.
Titles should be optional.
