===== This is a test of HTML templates =====

Note: The Doconce file cannot have a title (to avoid generating a
header). It should neither have an author.

======= This is a 7 heading =======

===== This is a 5 heading =====

The template can be any HTML file with header and footer and
three possible slots: *title*, *date* and *main*,
where *main* will become the Doconce file (the main body of text),
*title* is the first heading in the Doconce file, and
*date* is extracted from the Doconce file (if present).
