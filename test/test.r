__Abstract.__
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

# Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
# is mutually exclusive in LaTeX

======= Section 1 =======
label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

  * item1
  * item2
  * item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  * and a sublist
    * with indented subitem1
    * and a subitem2
  * and perhaps an ordered sublist
    o first item
    o second item,
      continuing on a new line

===== Subsection 1 =====

More text, with a reference back to Section ref{sec1} and further
to Section ref{subsubsec:ex}. idx{`somefunc` function}

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

@@@CODE ../doc/manual/__testcode.f fromto: subroutine@
and then just the subroutine,
@@@CODE ../doc/manual/__testcode.f from-to:a comment@^C\s+END1
and finally the complete file:
@@@CODE ../doc/manual/__testcode.f

Testing other code environments. First Python:
!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
!ec
Then Cython:
!bc cycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
!ec

# This one tests a + before a code environment
C++:
!bc cpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
!ec
System call:
!bc sys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
!ec

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the `verb` typesetting... Also test backslashes
like `\begin` and `\end` in inline verbatim text.

===== Subsection 2 =====
label{subsec:ex}
idx{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

FIGURE:[../doc/manual/figs/streamtubes, width=200] Visualization of flow by streamtubes. label{fig:impact}

Figures without captions are allowed.

FIGURE:[../doc/manual/figs/streamtubes, width=200]

idx{movies}
Test of movies.

MOVIE: [../doc/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg, width=700 height=400] Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal).

# Test empty caption:

MOVIE: [../doc/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg, width=700 height=400]

# Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption

   MOVIE: [../doc/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png, width=700 height=400] Movie
based on collection of frames
(here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).
label{mymov}

# Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the
# embed command that the YouTube page can generate

MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU, width=420 height=315] Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link.

# Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

 FIGURE: [../doc/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=500] A long
caption spanning
several lines.
label{myfig}

Movie ref{mymov} has a similar problem.

# Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem


# Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

===== The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?) =====
label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
!bc
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
!ec

__More on $\theta$.__ Here is more text.

===== Custom Environments =====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.


===== Tables =====
label{subsec:table}

Let us take this table from the manual:
idx{test index with `verbatim text` which is possible}

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in LaTeX, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
label{mytab}
}
% endif

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

% if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex"):
\end{table}
% endif

The Doconce source code reads
!bc ccq
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
!ec

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 1.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 3.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

===== URLs ======
label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl",
or the entire URL if desired, "URL": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
Here is a plain file link "URL": "testdoc.do.txt", or "url":"testdoc.do.txt",
or URL: "testdoc.do.txt" or url : "testdoc.do.txt" or "a link
with newline": "testdoc.do.txt". Can test spaces
with the link with word too: "hpl": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl" or
"hpl" : "http://folk.uio.no/hpl". The old syntax must also be
tested: http://folk.uio.no/hpl<hpl's homepage>. Now also `file:///`
works: "link to a file":"file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html"
is fine to have.

# Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because of reST):
# note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
# if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url".

% if FORMAT == "latex":

===== Test of Some LaTeX Fixes =====

Let's check abbr. of some common kind, e.g. the well-known i.e.
expression as an example. Moreover, Dr. Tang and Prof. Monsen,
or maybe also prof. Ting,
will go to the Dept. of Science to test how Mr. Hansen is doing together
with Ms. Larsen. A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e. since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig. 4 to see how the data compares with Tab. ref{mytab}.
% endif

===== LaTeX Mathematics =====

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
!bt
\[ a = b + c \]
!et
or with number and label, as in (ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
!bt
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to this equation by (ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
!bt
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
!et


% if FORMAT in ('latex', 'pdflatex', 'sphinx', 'html', 'pandoc'):
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
!bt
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 label{eq1} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x label{eq2}
\end{align}
!et
We can refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}).

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
!bt
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
!et
Testing split:
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to the last equation by (ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
!bt
\begin{gather}
a = b \\
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
!et

Testing alignat:
!bt
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 label{eq1a} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
!et
Let us refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (ref{eq1a})-(ref{eq2a}), and to (ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}
!et
% endif

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the exercises below.

======= Exercises =======

===== Problem: Flip a Coin =====
label{demo:ex:1}
file = flip_coin.py
solution = mysol.txt

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

!bhint
Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.
!ehint

# Test syntax error

  !bhint
Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
`r = random.randint(1,2)` and define head when `r` is 1.
  !ehint

!bans
If the `random.random()` function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.
!eans

!bsol
!bc pycod
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
!ec
!esol


===== Exercise: Compute a Probability =====

# Minimalistic exercise

label{demo:ex:2}

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?

!bhint
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.
!ehint

===== Project: Explore Distributions of Random Circles =====

label{proj:circle1}
file=circles.pdf

The formula for a circle is given by
!bt
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
!et
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:
!bc pypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
!ec

# Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
# which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.

!bsubex
Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

!bans
Here goes the short answer to part a).
!eans

!bsol
Here goes a full solution to part a).
!esol

!bhint
Use the `numpy.random` module to draw the
$x_0$, $y_0$, and $R$ quantities.
!ehint

!esubex

!bsubex
Let $R$ be uniformly distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ normally distributed.

file=norm.py  # test local filename for subexercise
!esubex

!bsubex
Let $R$ and $(x_0,y_0)$ be normally distributed.
!esubex

It is time to test <tt>verbatim inline font</tt> especially with <tt>a newline
inside the text</tt> and an exclamation mark at the end: <tt>BEGIN</tt>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the <tt>verb</tt> typesetting... Also test backslashes
like <tt>\begin</tt> and <tt>\end</tt> in inline verbatim text.

<h3>Custom Environments  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>
<p>
Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the <tt>.tex</tt> by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!

<p>

<p>

<p>
<!-- begin theorem -->
<a name="theorem:fundamental1"></a>

<p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b> Let \( a=1 \) and \( b=2 \). Then \( c=3 \).
<!-- end theorem -->

<p>
<!-- begin proof -->
<b>Proof.</b> Since \( c=a+b \), the result follows from straightforward addition.
\( \Diamond \)
<!-- end proof -->

<p>
As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

<h3>Tables <a name="subsec:table"></a>  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>
<p>

</table>
<p>

<p>
The Doconce source code reads

with newline</a>. Can test spaces
with the link with word too: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl">hpl</a> or
<a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl">hpl</a>. The old syntax must also be
tested: <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl">hpl's homepage</a>. Now also <tt>file:///</tt>
works: <a href="file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html">link to a file</a>
is fine to have.

<h3>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec7"></a></h3>
<p>
Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$ a = b + c $$
or with number and label, as in \eqref{my:eq1}, using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to this equation by \eqref{my:eq1}.

<p>
Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
$$

<p>

<p>
And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
$$
We can refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2}.

<p>
Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
$$
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
$$
Testing split:
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to the last equation by \eqref{split:envir:eq}.

<p>
Testing gather:
$$
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
$$

<p>
Testing alignat:
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
$$
Let us refer to \eqref{eq1}-\eqref{eq2} again, and to the
alignat variant \eqref{eq1a}-\eqref{eq2a}, and to \eqref{my:eq1}.

<p>
Testing eqnarray:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the exercises below.

<p>
<b>Hint 1.</b> Use <tt>r = random.random()</tt> and define head as <tt>r <= 0.5</tt>.

<p>
<b>Hint 2.</b> Draw an integer among \( \{1,2\} \) with
<tt>r = random.randint(1,2)</tt> and define head when <tt>r</tt> is 1.

<p>
<!-- --- begin short answer in exercise -->

<p>
<b>Answer.</b> If the <tt>random.random()</tt> function returns a number \( <1/2 \), let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this \( N \) number of times.

<h3>Compute a Probability <a name="demo:ex:2"></a>  <a name="___sec10"></a></h3>
<p>

<p>
<!-- Minimalistic exercise -->

<p>

<p>
What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval \( [0,1) \)?

<p>
<b>Hint.</b> To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw \( N \) such random numbers using Python's standard <tt>random</tt> module,
count how many of them, \( M \), that fall in the interval \( (0.5,0.6) \), and
compute the probability as \( M/N \).

<h3>Explore Distributions of Random Circles <a name="proj:circle1"></a>  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>
<p>

<p>
The formula for a circle is given by
$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
$$
where \( R \) is the radius of the circle, \( (x_0,y_0) \) is the
center point, and \( t \) is a parameter in the unit interval \( [0,1] \).
For any \( t \), \( (x,y) \) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate <tt>n</tt> points on a circle:

numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which

\section{Section 1}

\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\subsection{Subsection 1}

More text, with a reference back to Section~\ref{sec1} and further
to Section~\ref{subsubsec:ex}. \index{somefunc@{\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\bfcod
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efcod
and then just the subroutine,
\bfcod

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\efcod
and finally the complete file:
\bfpro
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efpro

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\bpycod
def f(x):
    return x+1
\epycod
Then Cython:
\bcycod
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\ecycod

% This one tests a + before a code environment
C++:
\bcpppro
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\ecpppro
System call:
\bsys
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\esys

It is time to test \code{verbatim inline font} especially with \code{a newline
inside the text} and an exclamation mark at the end: \code{BEGIN}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the \code{verb} typesetting... Also test backslashes
like \code{\begin} and \code{\end} in inline verbatim text.

\subsection{Subsection 2}

\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

%\clearpage % flush figures myfig


Movie~\ref{mymov} has a similar problem.

% Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem


% Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}

\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\bccq
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\eccq

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text.

\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the \code{.tex} by proper begin-end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



% begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

\subsection{Tables}

\label{subsec:table}

Let us take this table from the manual:
\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The Doconce source code reads
\bccq
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\eccq

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
1.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
3.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent

\subsection{URLs}

\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl},
or the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.
Here is a plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}},
or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link
with newline}. Can test spaces
with the link with word too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl} or
\href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}. The old syntax must also be
tested: \href{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}{hpl's homepage}. Now also \code{file:///}
works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html}}{link to a file}
is fine to have.

% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because of reST):
% note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url".

\subsection{Test of Some {\LaTeX} Fixes}

Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well-known i.e.
expression as an example. Moreover, Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen,
or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e.~since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.

\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}).

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the exercises below.


\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Flip a Coin}

\label{demo:ex:1}

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


% Test syntax error
\emph{Filename}: \code{flip_coin.py}.

\paragraph{Hint 1.}
Use \code{r = random.random()} and define head as \code{r <= 0.5}.

\paragraph{Hint 2.}
Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
\code{r = random.randint(1,2)} and define head when \code{r} is 1.

% --- begin short answer in exercise

\paragraph{Answer.}
If the \code{random.random()} function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.
% --- end short answer in exercise

% --- begin solution of exercise

\paragraph{Solution.}
Code:
\bpycod
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
\epycod

% --- end solution of exercise

% solution file: mysol.txt
% --- end of exercise

\subsection{Compute a Probability}

\label{demo:ex:2}

% Minimalistic exercise


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?

\paragraph{Hint.}
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard \code{random} module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

% --- end of exercise

\subsection{Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate \code{n} points on a circle:
\bpypro
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\epypro

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the \code{circle} function
above.
\emph{Filename}: \code{circles.pdf}.


\paragraph{a)}
Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

\paragraph{Hint.}
Use the \code{numpy.random} module to draw the
$x_0$, $y_0$, and $R$ quantities.

% --- begin short answer in exercise

\paragraph{Answer.}
Here goes the short answer to part a).
% --- end short answer in exercise

% --- begin solution of exercise

\paragraph{Solution.}
Here goes a full solution to part a).

% --- end solution of exercise

\paragraph{b)}
Let $R$ be uniformly distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ normally distributed.
\emph{Filename}: \code{norm.py}.

\paragraph{c)}
Let $R$ and $(x_0,y_0)$ be normally distributed.

The format of this document is
plain, homemade pdfLaTeX (from Doconce).


\begin{abstract}
This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

% Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter
% is mutually exclusive in {\LaTeX}
\end{abstract}


\section{Section 1}

\label{sec1}

Here is a nested list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item item1

  \item item2

  \item item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature

  \item and a sublist
\begin{itemize}

    \item with indented subitem1

    \item and a subitem2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item and perhaps an ordered sublist
\begin{enumerate}

   \item first item

   \item second item,
      continuing on a new line
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\subsection{Subsection 1}

More text, with a reference back to Section~\ref{sec1} and further
to Section~\ref{subsubsec:ex}. \index{somefunc@{\rm\texttt{somefunc}} function}

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent
and then just the subroutine,
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent
and finally the complete file:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
\noindent

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
\end{minted}
\noindent
Then Cython:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{cython}
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\end{minted}
\noindent

% This one tests a + before a code environment
C++:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{c++}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\end{minted}
\noindent
System call:
\vspace{4pt}
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=none,frame=lines,label=\fbox{{\tiny Terminal}},fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},
labelposition=topline,framesep=2.5mm,framerule=0.7pt]
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
\end{Verbatim}

It is time to test {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!verbatim inline font!} especially with {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!a newline inside the text!} and an exclamation mark at the end: {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!BEGIN!}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!verb!} typesetting... Also test backslashes
like {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\begin!} and {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\end!} in inline verbatim text.

\subsection{Subsection 2}

\label{subsec:ex}
\index{figures}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.


\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/manual/figs/streamtubes.png}}
  \caption{

\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures fig:impact


Figures without captions are allowed.


\begin{center}  % inline figure

\index{movies}

% Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption

 Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link.: \href{{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU}}{\nolinkurl{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU}}

% Test multi-line caption in figure

Here is figure~\ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../doc/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}

\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures myfig


Movie~\ref{mymov} has a similar problem.

% Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem


% Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}

\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text.

\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!.tex!} by proper begin-end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

\subsection{Tables}

\label{subsec:table}

Let us take this table from the manual:
\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The Doconce source code reads
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},tabsize=8,baselinestretch=0.85,
fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
1.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
3.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent

\subsection{URLs}

\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl},
or the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.
Here is a plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}},
or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link
with newline}. Can test spaces
with the link with word too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl} or
\href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}. The old syntax must also be
tested: \href{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}{hpl's homepage}. Now also {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!file:///!}
works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html}}{link to a file}
is fine to have.

% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because of reST):
% note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url".

\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}).

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the exercises below.


\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Flip a Coin}

\label{demo:ex:1}

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


% Test syntax error
\emph{Filename}: {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!flip_coin.py!}.

\paragraph{Hint 1.}
Use {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!r = random.random()!} and define head as {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!r <= 0.5!}.

\paragraph{Hint 2.}
Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!r = random.randint(1,2)!} and define head when {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!r!} is 1.

% --- begin short answer in exercise

\paragraph{Answer.}
If the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!random.random()!} function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.
% --- end short answer in exercise

% --- begin solution of exercise

\paragraph{Solution.}
Code:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
\end{minted}
\noindent

% --- end solution of exercise

% solution file: mysol.txt
% --- end of exercise

\subsection{Compute a Probability}

\label{demo:ex:2}

% Minimalistic exercise


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?

\paragraph{Hint.}
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!random!} module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

% --- end of exercise

\subsection{Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!n!} points on a circle:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\end{minted}
\noindent

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!circle!} function
above.
\emph{Filename}: {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!circles.pdf!}.


\paragraph{a)}
Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

\paragraph{Hint.}
Use the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!numpy.random!} module to draw the
$x_0$, $y_0$, and $R$ quantities.

% --- begin short answer in exercise

\paragraph{Answer.}
Here goes the short answer to part a).
% --- end short answer in exercise

% --- begin solution of exercise

\paragraph{Solution.}
Here goes a full solution to part a).

% --- end solution of exercise

\paragraph{b)}
Let $R$ be uniformly distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ normally distributed.
\emph{Filename}: {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!norm.py!}.

\paragraph{c)}
Let $R$ and $(x_0,y_0)$ be normally distributed.

Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}
and then just the subroutine,
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\end{minted}
and finally the complete file:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{fortran}
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\end{minted}

Testing other code environments. First Python:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
\end{minted}
Then Cython:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{cython}
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
\end{minted}

% This one tests a + before a code environment
C++:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{c++}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
\end{minted}
System call:
begin{quote}begin{Verbatim}
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
end{Verbatim}end{quote}

It is time to test {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!verbatim inline font!} especially with {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!a newline inside the text!} and an exclamation mark at the end: {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!BEGIN!}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!verb!} typesetting... Also test backslashes
like {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\begin!} and {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\end!} in inline verbatim text.

\subsection{Subsection 2}

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

\subsection{The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)}

\label{decay:sec:theta}

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\paragraph{More on $\theta$.}
Here is more text.

\subsection{Custom Environments}

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!.tex!} by proper begin-end {\LaTeX} environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

\subsection{Tables}

\label{subsec:table}

Let us take this table from the manual:
\index{test index with verbatim text@test index with {\rm\texttt{verbatim text}} which is possible}

\begin{table}
\caption{
Testing table environment in {\LaTeX}, enabled by testing on the "latex" format
with the preprocessor.
\label{mytab}
}


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
\end{table}

The Doconce source code reads
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
1.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
3.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent

\subsection{URLs}

\label{subsubsec:ex}

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl},
or the entire URL if desired, \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.
Here is a plain file link \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}},
or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{{testdoc.do.txt}}{a link
with newline}. Can test spaces
with the link with word too: \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl} or
\href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}. The old syntax must also be
tested: \href{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}{hpl's homepage}. Now also {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!file:///!}
works: \href{{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html}}{link to a file}
is fine to have.

% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because of reST):
% note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
% if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url".

\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}), using the equation environment:
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}).

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Testing split:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

Testing gather:
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

Testing alignat:
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Testing eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the exercises below.


\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Flip a Coin}

\label{demo:ex:1}

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


% Test syntax error
\emph{Filename}: {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!flip_coin.py!}.

\paragraph{Hint 1.}
Use {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!r = random.random()!} and define head as {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!r <= 0.5!}.

\paragraph{Hint 2.}
Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!r = random.randint(1,2)!} and define head when {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!r!} is 1.

% --- begin short answer in exercise

\paragraph{Answer.}
If the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!random.random()!} function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.
% --- end short answer in exercise

% --- begin solution of exercise

\paragraph{Solution.}
Code:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,mathescape,baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=7mm]{python}
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
\end{minted}

% --- end solution of exercise

% solution file: mysol.txt

\subsection{Compute a Probability}

\label{demo:ex:2}

% Minimalistic exercise


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?

\paragraph{Hint.}
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!random!} module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.

% --- end of exercise

\subsection{Explore Distributions of Random Circles}

\label{proj:circle1}

The formula for a circle is given by
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!n!} points on a circle:
\begin{python:nt}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
\end{python:nt}

% Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution
% which we normally want to keep where they are.

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!circle!} function
above.
\emph{Filename}: {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!circles.pdf!}.


\paragraph{a)}
Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

\paragraph{Hint.}
Use the {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!numpy.random!} module to draw the
$x_0$, $y_0$, and $R$ quantities.

More text, with a reference back to the section `Section 1`_ and further
to the section `URLs`_. 
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::


              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i

              program testme

and then just the subroutine::


        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file::

              program testme

              return


Testing other code environments. First Python::


        def f(x):

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_,

Here is a plain file link `<testdoc.do.txt>`_, or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_,
or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `<testdoc.do.txt>`_ or `a link
with newline <testdoc.do.txt>`_. Can test spaces
with the link with word too: `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_ or
`hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_. The old syntax must also be
tested: `hpl's homepage <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_. Now also ``file:///``
works: `link to a file <file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html>`_
is fine to have.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

        \begin{equation}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
        \end{equation}

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment::

        \begin{align*}
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        \end{align*}

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.

Compute a Probability
---------------------

.. Minimalistic exercise



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval [0,1)?

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw N such random numbers using Python's standard ``random`` module,
count how many of them, M, that fall in the interval (0.5,0.6), and
compute the probability as M/N.

.. --- end of exercise



.. _proj:circle1:

Explore Distributions of Random Circles
---------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate ``n`` points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)


.. Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution

.. which we normally want to keep where they are.


The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the ``circle`` function
above.
*Filename*: ``circles.pdf``.

*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

.. Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter

.. index:: somefunc function


Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine,

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file:

.. code-block:: fortran

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python:

.. code-block:: python

        def f(x):
            return x+1

Then Cython:

.. code-block:: cython

        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


.. This one tests a + before a code environment

C++:

.. code-block:: c++

        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

System call:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test ``verbatim inline font`` especially with ``a newline
inside the text`` and an exclamation mark at the end: ``BEGIN``! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the ``verb`` typesetting... Also test backslashes
like ``\begin`` and ``\end`` in inline verbatim text.

.. _subsec:ex:

Subsection 2
------------

.. index:: figures


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure :ref:`fig:impact` in which
there is a flow.


.. _fig:impact:

.. figure:: ../doc/manual/figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 200

   *Visualization of flow by streamtubes*


Figures without captions are allowed.


.. figure:: ../doc/manual/figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 200




.. index:: movies

Test of movies.

        <p>
        <em></em>
        </p>



.. Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption


.. raw:: html
        
        <p><a href="wavepacket_0001.html">Movie of files <tt>../doc/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png</tt></a>
        <em> Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).  </em></p>

.. Test multi-line caption in figure


Here is figure :ref:`myfig` with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.


.. _myfig:

.. figure:: ../doc/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png
   :width: 500

   *A long caption spanning several lines*


Movie :ref:`mymov` has a similar problem.

.. Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem



.. Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis


.. _decay:sec:theta:

The :math:`\theta` parameter (not :math:`\nabla`?)
--------------------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving :math:`\theta`:

.. code-block:: py


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


*More on :math:`\theta`.* Here is more text.

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the ``.tex`` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



.. begin theorem


*Theorem 5.* Let :math:`a=1` and :math:`b=2`. Then :math:`c=3`.
.. end theorem


.. begin proof

*Proof.* Since :math:`c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
:math:`\Diamond`
.. end proof


As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


.. _subsec:table:

Tables
------

Let us take this table from the manual:

.. index:: test index with verbatim text which is possible



============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============

4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads

.. code-block:: py


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|

          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

    time        velocity    acceleration

is fine to have.

.. if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url".



LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

.. math::
         a = b + c 

or with number and label, as in :eq:`my:eq1`, using the equation environment:

.. math::
   :label: my:eq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u 
        

We can refer to this equation by :eq:`my:eq1`.

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:

.. math::
        
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        



And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:

.. math::
        
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6  \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
        

We can refer to (:ref:`eq1`)-(:ref:`eq2`).

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:

.. math::
   :label: multiline:eq1
        
        a = b = q + \\ 
          f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

Testing split:

.. math::
   :label: split:envir:eq
        
        
        
        a = b = q &+ \\ 
          & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

We can refer to the last equation by :eq:`split:envir:eq`.

Testing gather:

.. math::
        
        a = b \\ 
        c = d + 7 + 9
        


Testing alignat:

.. math::
        \begin{alignat}{2}
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0  \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega 
        \end{alignat}

Let us refer to (:ref:`eq1`)-(:ref:`eq2`) again, and to the
alignat variant (:ref:`eq1a`)-(:ref:`eq2a`), and to :eq:`my:eq1`.

Testing eqnarray:

.. math::
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla^2 u + f, \\ 
        {\partial v\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g

Testing other code environments. First Python:
{{{
def f(x):
    return x+1
}}}
Then Cython:
{{{
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
}}}

<wiki:comment> This one tests a + before a code environment </wiki:comment>
C++:
{{{
#include <iostream>

int main()

   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
}}}
System call:
{{{
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f

output2
}}}

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the `verb` typesetting... Also test backslashes
like `\begin` and `\end` in inline verbatim text.

==== Subsection 2 ====

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.

Movie mymov has a similar problem.

<wiki:comment> Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem </wiki:comment>


<wiki:comment> Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis </wiki:comment>

==== The `\theta` parameter (not `\nabla`?) ====

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving `\theta`:
{{{
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
}}}

*More on `\theta`.* Here is more text.

==== Custom Environments ====

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<wiki:comment> begin theorem </wiki:comment>



*Theorem 5.* Let `a=1` and `b=2`. Then `c=3`.
<wiki:comment> end theorem </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> begin proof </wiki:comment>
*Proof.* Since `c=a+b`, the result follows from straightforward addition.
`END`
<wiki:comment> end proof </wiki:comment>

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

==== Tables ====

Let us take this table from the manual:



 ||      *time*       ||    *velocity*     ||  *acceleration*   ||
 ||  0.0              ||  1.4186           ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  2.0              ||  1.376512         ||  11.919           ||
 ||  4.0              ||  1.1E+1           ||  14.717624        ||



The Doconce source code reads
{{{
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
}}}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


 ||      *time*       ||    *velocity*     ||  *acceleration*   ||
 ||  0.0              ||  1.4186           ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  1.0              ||  1.376512         ||  11.919           ||
 ||  3.0              ||  1.1E+1           ||  14.717624        ||

==== URLs ====

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl],
or the entire URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.
Here is a plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt,
or testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or [testdoc.do.txt a link
with newline]. Can test spaces
with the link with word too: [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl] or
[http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl]. The old syntax must also be
tested: [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl's homepage]. Now also `file:///`
works: [file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html link to a file]
is fine to have.

<wiki:comment> Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because of reST): </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". </wiki:comment>

==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
{{{
\[ a = b + c \]
}}}
or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
{{{
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
}}}
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
{{{
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
}}}



More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the exercises below.

==== Flip a Coin ====

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin `N` times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


<wiki:comment> Test syntax error </wiki:comment>
*Filename*: `flip_coin.py`.

*Hint 1.* Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.

==== Compute a Probability ====

<wiki:comment> Minimalistic exercise </wiki:comment>


What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval `[0,1)`?

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw `N` such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, `M`, that fall in the interval `(0.5,0.6)`, and
compute the probability as `M/N`.

<wiki:comment> --- end of exercise </wiki:comment>

==== Explore Distributions of Random Circles ====

The formula for a circle is given by
{{{
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
}}}
where `R` is the radius of the circle, `(x_0,y_0)` is the
center point, and `t` is a parameter in the unit interval `[0,1]`.
For any `t`, `(x,y)` is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:
{{{
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
}}}

<wiki:comment> Often in an exercise we have some comments about the solution </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> which we normally want to keep where they are. </wiki:comment>

The goal of this project is to draw `N` circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.
*Filename*: `circles.pdf`.


*a)* Let `R` be normally distributed and `(x_0,y_0)` uniformly distributed.

*Hint.* Use the `numpy.random` module to draw the
`x_0`, `y_0`, and `R` quantities.

''Abstract.'' This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

<!--> Cannot demonstrate chapter headings since abstract and chapter -->
<!--> is mutually exclusive in LaTeX -->



== Section 1 ==

Here is a nested list:


<ul>
  <li> item1  <li> item2  <li> item3 which continues    on the next line to test that feature  <li> and a sublist
<ul>
    <li><li> with indented subitem1    <li><li> and a subitem2</ul>

  <li> and perhaps an ordered sublist
<ol>
   <li><li> first item   <li><li> second item,      continuing on a new line</ol>

</ul>

==== Subsection 1 ====

More text, with a reference back to the section [#Section_1] and further
to the section [#URLs]. 
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</code>
and then just the subroutine,
<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
</code>
and finally the complete file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</code>

Testing other code environments. First Python:
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
def f(x):
    return x+1
</code>
Then Cython:
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">

    return x + 1

<!--> This one tests a + before a code environment -->
C++:
<syntaxhighlight lang="cpp">

   return 0
}
</code>
System call:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
</code>

It is time to test <code>verbatim inline font</code> especially with <code>a newline
inside the text</code> and an exclamation mark at the end: <code>BEGIN</code>! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the <code>verb</code> typesetting... Also test backslashes

== Subsection 1 ==

More text, with a reference back to the section [#Section_1] and further
to the section [#URLs]. 
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end,

{{{
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}
and then just the subroutine,
{{{

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
}}}
and finally the complete file:
{{{
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}

Testing other code environments. First Python:
{{{
def f(x):
    return x+1
}}}
Then Cython:
{{{
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
}}}

<wiki:comment> This one tests a + before a code environment </wiki:comment>
C++:
{{{
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
}}}
System call:
{{{
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
}}}

It is time to test {{{verbatim inline font}}} especially with {{{a newline
inside the text}}} and an exclamation mark at the end: {{{BEGIN}}}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the {{{verb}}} typesetting... Also test backslashes
like {{{\begin}}} and {{{\end}}} in inline verbatim text.


== Subsection 2 ==

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure fig:impact in which
there is a flow.

{{../doc/manual/figs/streamtubes.png| Visualization of flow by streamtubes. (fig:impact)}}

Figures without captions are allowed.

{{../doc/manual/figs/streamtubes.png|}}

Test of movies.

 Mjolnir tsunami (by Sylfest Glimsdal). (Movie ../doc/manual/figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play [[mjolnir.html]])

<wiki:comment> Test empty caption: </wiki:comment>

 (Movie ../doc/manual/figs/wavepacket.mpeg: play [[wavepacket.html]])

<wiki:comment> Test wrong syntax and multi-line caption </wiki:comment>


 Movie based on collection of frames (here just a few frames compared with the full wavepacket.mpeg movie).   (Movie of files {{{../doc/manual/figs/wavepacket_*.png}}} in [[wavepacket_0001.html]])


<wiki:comment> Check out the correct with and height of YouTube movies from the </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> embed command that the YouTube page can generate </wiki:comment>

 Movies can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded as HTML or as a link.: [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7iUiftbKU]]

<wiki:comment> Test multi-line caption in figure </wiki:comment>

Here is figure myfig with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

{{../doc/manual/figs/wavepacket_0001.png| A long caption spanning several lines. (myfig) }}

Movie mymov has a similar problem.

<wiki:comment> Must be a blank line after MOVIE or FIGURE to detect this problem </wiki:comment>


<wiki:comment> Somewhat challenging heading with latex math, \t, \n, ? and parenthesis </wiki:comment>


== The {{{\theta}}} parameter (not {{{\nabla}}}?) ==

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving {{{\theta}}}:
{{{
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
}}}

//More on {{{\theta}}}.// Here is more text.


== Custom Environments ==

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the {{{.tex}}} by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!



<wiki:comment> begin theorem </wiki:comment>



//Theorem 5.// Let {{{a=1}}} and {{{b=2}}}. Then {{{c=3}}}.
<wiki:comment> end theorem </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> begin proof </wiki:comment>
//Proof.// Since {{{c=a+b}}}, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END
<wiki:comment> end proof </wiki:comment>

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


== Tables ==

Let us take this table from the manual:



 | =time             | =velocity         | =acceleration     |
 |  0.0              |  1.4186           |  -5.01            |
 |  2.0              |  1.376512         |  11.919           |
 |  4.0              |  1.1E+1           |  14.717624        |



The Doconce source code reads
{{{
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
}}}

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


 | =time             | =velocity         | =acceleration     |
 |  0.0              |  1.4186           |  -5.01            |
 |  1.0              |  1.376512         |  11.919           |
 |  3.0              |  1.1E+1           |  14.717624        |


== URLs ==

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]],
or the entire URL if desired, [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl]].
Here is a plain file link [[testdoc.do.txt]], or [[testdoc.do.txt]],
or [[testdoc.do.txt]] or [[testdoc.do.txt]] or [[testdoc.do.txt|a link
with newline]]. Can test spaces
with the link with word too: [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]] or
[[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]]. The old syntax must also be
tested: [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl's homepage]]. Now also {{{file:///}}}
works: [[file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html|link to a file]]
is fine to have.

<wiki:comment> Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because of reST): </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url". </wiki:comment>


== LaTeX Mathematics ==

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
{{{
\[ a = b + c \]
}}}
or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
{{{
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
}}}
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
{{{
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
}}}



More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the exercises below.

The formula for a circle is given by
{{{
\begin{align}

}}}
where {{{R}}} is the radius of the circle, {{{(x_0,y_0)}}} is the
center point, and {{{t}}} is a parameter in the unit interval {{{[0,1]}}}.
For any {{{t}}}, {{{(x,y)}}} is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate {{{n}}} points on a circle:
{{{
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)

S. Overworked (Inst1, and Inst2, Somewhere, and Third Inst, Elsewhere, and Fourth Inst); J. DoeDATE: today



The format of this document is
st
*Abstract.* This is a document with many test constructions for doconce syntax.
It was used heavily for the development and kept for testing
numerous constructions, also special and less common cases.

And exactly for test purposes we have an extra line here, which
is part of the abstract.

Section 1

Here is a nested list:

  - item1
  - item2
  - item3 which continues
    on the next line to test that feature
  - and a sublist
    - with indented subitem1
    - and a subitem2

  - and perhaps an ordered sublist
   1. first item
   2. second item,
      continuing on a new line

Subsection 1

More text, with a reference back to the section "Section 1" and further
to the section "URLs". 
Let's do some copying from files too. First from subroutine up to the very end::


              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return

and then just the subroutine::


        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return

and finally the complete file::

              subroutine    test()
              integer i

              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do

              program testme
              call test()
              return


Testing other code environments. First Python::


        def f(x):
            return x+1

Then Cython::


        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


C++::


        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

System call::


        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test 'verbatim inline font' especially with 'a newline
inside the text' and an exclamation mark at the end: 'BEGIN'! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the 'verb' typesetting... Also test backslashes
like '\begin' and '\end' in inline verbatim text.

Subsection 2

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

Movie ref{mymov} has a similar problem.

The \theta parameter (not \nabla?)

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving \theta::


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


*More on \theta.* Here is more text.

Custom Environments

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the '.tex' by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!




*Theorem 5.* Let a=1 and b=2. Then c=3.

*Proof.* Since c=a+b, the result follows from straightforward addition.
END

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment::

        \begin{equation}

Exercises

Flip a Coin

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin N times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


*Filename*: 'flip_coin.py'.

*Hint 1.* Use 'r = random.random()' and define head as 'r <= 0.5'.

*Hint 2.* Draw an integer among \{1,2\} with
'r = random.randint(1,2)' and define head when 'r' is 1.


*Answer.* If the 'random.random()' function returns a number <1/2, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this N number of times.


*Solution.* Code::


        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)


Compute a Probability

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval [0,1)?

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw N such random numbers using Python's standard 'random' module,
count how many of them, M, that fall in the interval (0.5,0.6), and
compute the probability as M/N.

Explore Distributions of Random Circles

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate 'n' points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)



The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the 'circle' function
above.
*Filename*: 'circles.pdf'.


*a)* Let R be normally distributed and (x_0,y_0) uniformly distributed.

*Hint.* Use the 'numpy.random' module to draw the
x_0, y_0, and R quantities.


*Answer.* Here goes the short answer to part a).


*Solution.* Here goes a full solution to part a).


*b)* Let R be uniformly distributed and (x_0,y_0) normally distributed.
*Filename*: 'norm.py'.

*c)* Let R and (x_0,y_0) be normally distributed.

Testing other code environments. First Python::


        def f(x):
            return x+1

Then Cython::


        cpdef f(double x):
            return x + 1


C++::


        #include <iostream>
        
        int main()
        {
           std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
           return 0
        }

System call::


        Terminal> mkdir test
        Terminal> cd test
        Terminal> myprog -f
        output1
        output2


It is time to test C{verbatim inline font} especially with C{a newline
inside the text} and an exclamation mark at the end: C{BEGIN}! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the C{verb} typesetting... Also test backslashes
like C{\begin} and C{\end} in inline verbatim text.

Subsection 2

Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

The M{\theta} parameter (not M{\nabla}?)
----------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving M{\theta}::


        def f(theta):
            return theta**2


I{More on M{\theta}.} Here is more text.

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the C{.tex} by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!




I{Theorem 5.} Let M{a=1} and M{b=2}. Then M{c=3}.

I{Proof.} Since M{c=a+b}, the result follows from straightforward addition.
M{END}

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


Tables
------

Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01

4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |

          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>},
or the entire URL if desired, U{http://folk.uio.no/hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}.
Here is a plain file link U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>}, or U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>},
or U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>} or U{testdoc.do.txt<testdoc.do.txt>} or U{a link
with newline<testdoc.do.txt>}. Can test spaces
with the link with word too: U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>} or
U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}. The old syntax must also be
tested: U{hpl's homepage<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}. Now also C{file:///}
works: U{link to a file<file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html>}
is fine to have.

Exercises
=========

Flip a Coin
-----------

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin M{N} times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


I{Filename}: C{flip_coin.py}.

I{Hint 1.} Use C{r = random.random()} and define head as C{r <= 0.5}.

I{Hint 2.} Draw an integer among M{\{1,2\}} with
C{r = random.randint(1,2)} and define head when C{r} is 1.


I{Answer.} If the C{random.random()} function returns a number M{<1/2}, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this M{N} number of times.


I{Solution.} Code::


        import sys, random
        N = int(sys.argv[1])
        heads = 0
        for i in range(N):
            r = random.random()
            if r <= 0.5:
                heads += 1
        print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)





Compute a Probability
---------------------



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval M{[0,1)}?

I{Hint.} To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw M{N} such random numbers using Python's standard C{random} module,
count how many of them, M{M}, that fall in the interval M{(0.5,0.6)}, and
compute the probability as M{M/N}.



Explore Distributions of Random Circles
---------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where M{R} is the radius of the circle, M{(x_0,y_0)} is the
center point, and M{t} is a parameter in the unit interval M{[0,1]}.
For any M{t}, M{(x,y)} is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate C{n} points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)



The goal of this project is to draw M{N} circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the C{circle} function
above.
I{Filename}: C{circles.pdf}.


I{a)} Let M{R} be normally distributed and M{(x_0,y_0)} uniformly distributed.

I{Hint.} Use the C{numpy.random} module to draw the
M{x_0}, M{y_0}, and M{R} quantities.


I{Answer.} Here goes the short answer to part a).


I{Solution.} Here goes a full solution to part a).


I{b)} Let M{R} be uniformly distributed and M{(x_0,y_0)} normally distributed.
I{Filename}: C{norm.py}.

I{c)} Let M{R} and M{(x_0,y_0)} be normally distributed.

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program

Explore Distributions of Random Circles
---------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by::

        \begin{align}
        x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
        y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
        \end{align}

where R is the radius of the circle, (x_0,y_0) is the
center point, and t is a parameter in the unit interval [0,1].
For any t, (x,y) is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate n points on a circle::


        import numpy as np
        
        def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
            t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
            x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
            y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
            return x, y
        
        x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)



The goal of this project is to draw N circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the circle function
above.
*Filename*: circles.pdf.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and then just the subroutine,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and finally the complete file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing other code environments. First Python:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
def f(x):
    return x+1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then Cython:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cpdef f(double x):
    return x + 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C++:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Cpp}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Sample output" << std::endl;
   return 0
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

System call:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> mkdir test
Terminal> cd test
Terminal> myprog -f
output1
output2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is time to test `verbatim inline font` especially with `a newline
inside the text` and an exclamation mark at the end: `BEGIN`! The
exclamation mark inside the verbatim text is not smart for latex as
we use ! in the `verb` typesetting... Also test backslashes
like `\begin` and `\end` in inline verbatim text.

Subsection 2
------------


Test of figures. In particular we refer to Figure ref{fig:impact} in which
there is a flow.

Figures without captions are allowed.

Here is figure ref{myfig} with a long multi-line caption
and an extra space before the FIGURE keyword.

Movie ref{mymov} has a similar problem.




The $\theta$ parameter (not $\nabla$?)
--------------------------------------

Functions do not always need to be advanced, here is one
involving $\theta$:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
def f(theta):
    return theta**2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*More on $\theta$.* Here is more text.

Custom Environments
-------------------

Here is an attempt to create a theorem environment via Mako
(for counting theorems) and comment lines to help replacing lines in
the `.tex` by proper begin-end LaTeX environments for theorems.
Should look nice in most formats!




*Theorem 5.* Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.

*Proof.* Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.


Tables
------

Let us take this table from the manual:



    time        velocity    acceleration  
------------  ------------  ------------  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  



The Doconce source code reads

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:


    time        velocity    acceleration  
------------  ------------  ------------  
0.0           1.4186        -5.01         
1.0           1.376512      11.919        
3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624     


URLs
----

Testing of URLs: hpl's home page [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl),
or the entire URL if desired, <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>.
Here is a plain file link <testdoc.do.txt>, or <testdoc.do.txt>,
or <testdoc.do.txt> or <testdoc.do.txt> or [a link
with newline](testdoc.do.txt). Can test spaces
with the link with word too: [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl) or
[hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl). The old syntax must also be
tested: hpl's homepage (http://folk.uio.no/hpl). Now also `file:///`
works: [link to a file](file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html)
is fine to have.



LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:
$$ a = b + c $$
or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1), using the equation environment:
$$
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-astrisk environment:
$$
\begin{align*}
\pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
\end{align*}
$$


And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:
$$
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
$$
We can refer to Equations (eq1)-(eq2).

Many of the next environments will fail in non-latex formats.
Testing multiline:
$$
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
$$
Testing split:
$$
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
We can refer to the last equation by Equation (split:envir:eq).

Testing gather:
$$
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
$$

Testing alignat:
$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
$$
Let us refer to Equations (eq1)-(eq2) again, and to the
alignat variant Equations (eq1a)-(eq2a), and to Equation (my:eq1).

Testing eqnarray:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g \label{myeq2}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the exercises below.

Exercises
=========

Flip a Coin
-----------

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


*Filename*: `flip_coin.py`.

*Hint 1.* Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.

*Hint 2.* Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
`r = random.randint(1,2)` and define head when `r` is 1.


*Answer.* If the `random.random()` function returns a number $<1/2$, let it be
head, otherwise tail. Repeat this $N$ number of times.


*Solution.* Code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
import sys, random
N = int(sys.argv[1])
heads = 0
for i in range(N):
    r = random.random()
    if r <= 0.5:
        heads += 1
print 'Flipping a coin %d times gave %d heads' % (N, heads)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compute a Probability
---------------------



What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?

*Hint.* To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$.



Explore Distributions of Random Circles
---------------------------------------

The formula for a circle is given by
$$
\begin{align}
x &= x_0 + R\cos 2\pi t,\\ 
y &= y_0 + R\sin 2\pi t,
\end{align}
$$
where $R$ is the radius of the circle, $(x_0,y_0)$ is the
center point, and $t$ is a parameter in the unit interval $[0,1]$.
For any $t$, $(x,y)$ is a point on the circle.
The formula can be used to generate `n` points on a circle:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
import numpy as np

def circle(R, x0, y0, n=501):
    t = np.linspace(0, 1, n)
    x = x0 + R*np.cos(2*np.pi*t)
    y = y0 + R*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
    return x, y

x, y = circle(2.0, 0, 0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal of this project is to draw $N$ circles with random
center and radius. Plot each circle using the `circle` function
above.
*Filename*: `circles.pdf`.


*a)* Let $R$ be normally distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ uniformly distributed.

*Hint.* Use the `numpy.random` module to draw the
$x_0$, $y_0$, and $R$ quantities.


*Answer.* Here goes the short answer to part a).


*Solution.* Here goes a full solution to part a).


*b)* Let $R$ be uniformly distributed and $(x_0,y_0)$ normally distributed.
*Filename*: `norm.py`.

*c)* Let $R$ and $(x_0,y_0)$ be normally distributed.

<p>Let’s check abbr. of some common kind, e.g. the well-known i.e. expression as an example. Moreover, Dr. Tang and Prof. Monsen, or maybe also prof. Ting, will go to the Dept. of Science to test how Mr. Hansen is doing together with Ms. Larsen. A sentence containing &quot;refines lines&quot; could easily fool a regex substitution with only i.e. since the dot matches anything. Also, look at Fig. 4 to see how the data compares with Tab. [mytab].</p>

<pre class="sourceCode Python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="ch">import</span> numpy <span class="ch">as</span> np

<span class="kw">def</span> circle(R, x0, y0, n=<span class="dv">501</span>):
    t = np.linspace(<span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>, n)

<p>The goal of this project is to draw \(N\) circles with random center and radius. Plot each circle using the <code>circle</code> function above. <em>Filename</em>: <code>circles.pdf</code>.</p>
<p><em>a)</em> Let \(R\) be normally distributed and \((x_0,y_0)\) uniformly distributed.</p>
<p><em>Hint.</em> Use the <code>numpy.random</code> module to draw the \(x_0\), \(y_0\), and \(R\) quantities.</p>
<p><em>Answer.</em> Here goes the short answer to part a).</p>
<p><em>Solution.</em> Here goes a full solution to part a).</p>
<p><em>b)</em> Let \(R\) be uniformly distributed and \((x_0,y_0)\) normally distributed. <em>Filename</em>: <code>norm.py</code>.</p>
<p><em>c)</em> Let \(R\) and \((x_0,y_0)\) be normally distributed.</p>

DATE: today

===== This is a test of HTML templates =====

Note: When using HTML templates, the Doconce file cannot have a title
(to avoid generating a header). It should neither have an author.

======= This is a 7 heading =======

Here is some code:
!bc pycod
class Diff:
    def __init__(self, f, h=1E-5):
        self.f = f
        self.h = float(h)

class Forward1(Diff):
    def __call__(self, x):
        f, h = self.f, self.h
        return (f(x+h) - f(x))/h
!ec

===== This is a 5 heading =====

The template can be any HTML file with header and footer and
three possible slots: *title*, *date* and *main*,
where *main* will become the Doconce file (the main body of text),
*title* is the first heading in the Doconce file, and
*date* is extracted from the Doconce file (if present).

<TITLE>Demo of Doconce formats</TITLE>
<H3>Doconce demo</H3>

Doconce is a minimum tagged markup language. The file
<a href="tutorial.do.txt">tutorial.do.txt</a> is the source of the
Doconce tutorial, written in the Doconce format.
Running
<pre>
doconce format html tutorial.do.txt
</pre>
produces the HTML file <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial.html</a>.
Going from Doconce to LaTeX is done by
<pre>
doconce format latex tutorial.do.txt
</pre>
resulting in the file <a href="tutorial.tex">tutorial.tex</a>, which can
be compiled to a PDF file <a href="tutorial.pdf">tutorial.pdf</a>
by running <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>dvipdf</tt> the standard way.
<p>
The reStructuredText (reST) format is of particular interest:
<pre>
doconce format rst    tutorial.do.txt  # standard reST
doconce format sphinx tutorial.do.txt  # Sphinx extension of reST
</pre>
The reST file <a href="tutorial.rst">tutorial.rst</a> is a starting point
for conversion to many other formats: OpenOffice,
<a href="tutorial.xml">XML</a>, <a href="tutorial.rst.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="tutorial.rst.tex">LaTeX</a>,
and from LaTeX to <a href="tutorial.rst.pdf">PDF</a>.
The <a href="tutorial.sphinx.rst">Sphinx</a> dialect of reST
can be translated to <a href="tutorial.sphinx.pdf">PDF</a>
and <a href="html/index.html">HTML</a>.
<p>
Doconce can also be converted to
<a href="tutorial.gwiki">Googlecode wiki</a>,
<a href="tutorial.cwiki">Creole wiki</a>,
<a href="tutorial.mwiki">MediaWiki wiki</a>,
<a href="tutorial.mkd">Markdown</a> (Pandoc extension),

TITLE: Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Simula Research Laboratory and University of Oslo
DATE: today


 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like "LaTeX":"http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf", "HTML":"http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/", "reStructuredText":"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html", "Sphinx":"http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html", and "wiki":"http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax"? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


======= The Doconce Concept  =======

# #include "_what_is.do.txt"

======= What Does Doconce Look Like? =======

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.

  * Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.

  * *Emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks.

  * _Words in boldface_ are surrounded by underscores.

  * Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset `verbatim (in a monospace font)`.

  * Section headings are recognied by equality (`=`) signs before
    and after the title, and the number of `=` signs indicates the
    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and
    3 for subsubsection.

  * Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading.

  * The abstract of a document starts with *Abstract* as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,

  * Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    `!bc` (begin code) and `!ec` (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block.

  * Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.

  * Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    `!bt` (begin TeX) and `!et` (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block.

  * There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.

  * Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.

  * Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout
    the text.

  * Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can
    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such
    comments).

  * There is special support for advanced exercises features.

  * With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text.

  * With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
!bc
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
!ec
The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an `o`
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

===== Mathematics and Computer Code =====

Inline mathematics, such as $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$ is
typeset as
!bc
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
!ec
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
`!bt` and `!et` (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
!bt
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
!et
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes `latex`, `pdflatex`, `html`, and `sphinx`). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
`!bc` and `!ec` instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like
!bc cod
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
!ec
A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to `sphinx`, `rst`, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., `!bc xxx`
where `xxx` is an identifier like `pycod` for code snippet in Python,
`sys` for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in `ptex2tex` and defined in a
configuration file `.ptext2tex.cfg`, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):
!bc
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
!ec
By default, `pro` and `cod` are `python`, `sys` is `console`,
while `xpro` and `xcod` are computer language specific for `x`
in `f` (Fortran), `c` (C), `cpp` (C++), `pl` (Perl), `m` (Matlab),
`sh` (Unix shells), `cy` (Cython), and `py` (Python).

# (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code
# blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments
# and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the
# first one is used.)

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with `!bc pro`, while a part of a file is copied into a `!bc cod`
environment. What `pro` and `cod` mean is then defined through
a `.ptex2tex.cfg` file for LaTeX and a `sphinx code-blocks`
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing `#include "mynote.do.txt"`
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension `do.txt`. The `do` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing `.txt` denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


===== Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography =====
label{newcommands}

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the `doc/manual/manual.do.txt` file (see the
"demo page": "https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html"
for various formats of this document).


# Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess):

# #include "_doconce2anything.do.txt"


===== Demos =====

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file
!bc
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
!ec
The file `make.sh` in the `tutorial` directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, `tutorial.do.txt` is the
starting point.  Running `make.sh` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original `tutorial.do.txt` file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
"Here": "https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html"
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the `docs/manual` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, `manual.do.txt`, to
various formats. The `make.sh` script runs a set of translations.

<h2>The Doconce Concept   <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
<p>
Doconce is two things:

<p>

<ol>
 <li> Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via <tt>rst2*</tt> programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via <tt>unoconv</tt>) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.
 <li> Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".
</ol>

Here are some Doconce features:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  <li> Doconce can be converted to plain <em>untagged</em> text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  <li> Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.
  <li> Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  <li> Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  <li> Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.
</ul>

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  <li> Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  <li> Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.
</ul>

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

<p>
Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.

<h2>What Does Doconce Look Like?  <a name="___sec1"></a></h2>
<p>
Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.
  <li> <em>Emphasized words</em> are surrounded by asterisks.
  <li> <b>Words in boldface</b> are surrounded by underscores.
  <li> Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset <tt>verbatim (in a monospace font)</tt>.
  <li> Section headings are recognied by equality (<tt>=</tt>) signs before
    and after the title, and the number of <tt>=</tt> signs indicates the
    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and
    3 for subsubsection.
  <li> Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading.
  <li> The abstract of a document starts with <em>Abstract</em> as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,
  <li> Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    <tt>!bc</tt> (begin code) and <tt>!ec</tt> (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block.
  <li> Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.
  <li> Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    <tt>!bt</tt> (begin TeX) and <tt>!et</tt> (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block.
  <li> There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.
  <li> Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.
  <li> Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout
    the text.
  <li> Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can
    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such
    comments).
  <li> There is special support for advanced exercises features.
  <li> With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text.
  <li> With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.
</ul>

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
\label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

<p>

<h3>A Subsection with Sample Text <a name="my:first:sec"></a>  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>
<p>

<p>
Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
<b>boldface</b> words, <em>emphasized</em> words, and <tt>computer</tt> words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

<p>

<ul>
  <li> item 1
  <li> item 2
  <li> item 3
</ul>

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an <tt>o</tt>
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

<p>

<ol>
 <li> item 1
 <li> item 2
 <li> item 3
</ol>

URLs with a link word are possible, as in <a href="http://folk.uio.no/hpl">hpl</a>.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in <a href="tutorial.do.txt"><tt>tutorial.do.txt</tt></a>.

<p>
References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section <a href="#my:first:sec">A Subsection with Sample Text</a>.

<p>
Doconce also allows inline comments such as [<b>hpl</b>: <em>here I will make
some remarks to the text</em>] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section <a href="#doconce2formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</a> for an example).

<p>
Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>    time    </b></td> <td align="center"><b>  velocity  </b></td> <td align="center"><b>acceleration</b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>

<h3>Mathematics and Computer Code  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>
<p>
Inline mathematics, such as \( \nu = \sin(x) \),
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like \( \nu = \sin(x) \) is
typeset as
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

<p>
Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
<tt>!bt</tt> and <tt>!et</tt> (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
$$
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
$$
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes <tt>latex</tt>, <tt>pdflatex</tt>, <tt>html</tt>, and <tt>sphinx</tt>). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

<p>
You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
<tt>!bc</tt> and <tt>!ec</tt> instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  cod-->
<pre>
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to <tt>sphinx</tt>, <tt>rst</tt>, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

<p>
It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., <tt>!bc xxx</tt>
where <tt>xxx</tt> is an identifier like <tt>pycod</tt> for code snippet in Python,
<tt>sys</tt> for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in <tt>ptex2tex</tt> and defined in a
configuration file <tt>.ptext2tex.cfg</tt>, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
By default, <tt>pro</tt> and <tt>cod</tt> are <tt>python</tt>, <tt>sys</tt> is <tt>console</tt>,
while <tt>xpro</tt> and <tt>xcod</tt> are computer language specific for <tt>x</tt>
in <tt>f</tt> (Fortran), <tt>c</tt> (C), <tt>cpp</tt> (C++), <tt>pl</tt> (Perl), <tt>m</tt> (Matlab),
<tt>sh</tt> (Unix shells), <tt>cy</tt> (Cython), and <tt>py</tt> (Python).

<p>
<!-- (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code -->
<!-- blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments -->
<!-- and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the -->
<!-- first one is used.) -->

<p>
One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with <tt>!bc pro</tt>, while a part of a file is copied into a <tt>!bc cod</tt>
environment. What <tt>pro</tt> and <tt>cod</tt> mean is then defined through
a <tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt> file for LaTeX and a <tt>sphinx code-blocks</tt>
comment for Sphinx.

<p>
Another document can be included by writing <tt>#include "mynote.do.txt"</tt>
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension <tt>do.txt</tt>. The <tt>do</tt> part stands for doconce, while the
trailing <tt>.txt</tt> denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography <a name="newcommands"></a>  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>
<p>

<p>
Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style <em>newcommand</em>
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
<tt>newcommand_replace.tex</tt> are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names <tt>newcommands.tex</tt> and
<tt>newcommands_keep.tex</tt> are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
<tt>!bt</tt> and <tt>!et</tt> in <tt>newcommands_keep.tex</tt> to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
<tt>newcommands_replace.tex</tt> and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the <tt>newcommands*.tex</tt> files <em>must</em> appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

<p>
Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the <tt>doc/manual/manual.do.txt</tt> file (see the
<a href="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html">demo page</a>
for various formats of this document).

<p>

<p>
<!-- Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess): -->

<p>

<p>

<h2>From Doconce to Other Formats <a name="doconce2formats"></a>  <a name="___sec5"></a></h2>
<p>

<p>
Transformation of a Doconce document <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt> to various other
formats applies the script <tt>doconce format</tt>:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
or just
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format format mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>mako</tt> or <tt>preprocess</tt> programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to <tt>mako</tt> or <tt>preprocess</tt> can be added after the
filename. For example,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The variable <tt>FORMAT</tt> is always defined as the current format when
running <tt>preprocess</tt>. That is, in the last example, <tt>FORMAT</tt> is
defined as <tt>latex</tt>. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like <tt>#if FORMAT == "latex"</tt>.

<p>
The command-line arguments <tt>--no-preprocess</tt> and <tt>--no-mako</tt> turn off
running <tt>preprocess</tt> and <tt>mako</tt>, respectively.

<p>
Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

<p>

<p>

<h3>HTML  <a name="___sec6"></a></h3>
<p>
Making an HTML version of a Doconce file <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt>
is performed by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format html mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The resulting file <tt>mydoc.html</tt> can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

<p>
If the Pygments package (including the <tt>pygmentize</tt> program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument <tt>--no-pygments-html</tt>
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain <tt><pre></tt> HTML tags. The option <tt>--pygments-html-linenos</tt> turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

<p>
The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": <tt>%(title)s</tt> for a title,
<tt>%(date)s</tt> for a date, and <tt>%(main)s</tt> for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
<tt>DATE:</tt> line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert <tt>%(title)s</tt> and
<tt>%(date)s</tt> at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by <tt>%(main)s</tt>. Here is an example:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h3>Pandoc and Markdown  <a name="___sec7"></a></h3>
<p>
Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The name of the output file is <tt>mydoc.mkd</tt>.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Pandoc supports <tt>latex</tt>, <tt>html</tt>, <tt>odt</tt> (OpenOffice), <tt>docx</tt> (Microsoft
Word), <tt>rtf</tt>, <tt>texinfo</tt>, to mention some. The <tt>-R</tt> option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the <tt>--toc</tt> option generates a table of contents.
See the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc documentation</a>
for the many features of the <tt>pandoc</tt> program.

<p>
Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
<tt>doconce format pandoc</tt> and then translating using <tt>pandoc</tt>, or
<tt>doconce format latex</tt>, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using <tt>pandoc</tt>.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal&gt; pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
When we go through <tt>pandoc</tt>, only single equations or <tt>align*</tt>
environments are well understood.

<p>
Quite some <tt>doconce replace</tt> and <tt>doconce subst</tt> edits might be needed
on the <tt>.mkd</tt> or <tt>.tex</tt> files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

<p>
Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal&gt; pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>-s</tt> option adds a proper header and footer to the <tt>mydoc.html</tt> file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

<p>

<p>

<h3>LaTeX  <a name="___sec8"></a></h3>
<p>
Making a LaTeX file <tt>mydoc.tex</tt> from <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt> is done in two steps:
<!-- Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many -->
<!-- formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph -->
<!-- environment, as used here. -->

<p>
<b>Step 1.</b> Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form <tt>mydoc.p.tex</tt> for
the <tt>ptex2tex</tt> program (or <tt>doconce ptex2tex</tt>):
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files <tt>newcommands.tex</tt>, <tt>newcommands_keep.tex</tt>, or
<tt>newcommands_replace.tex</tt> (see the section <a href="#newcommands">Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography</a>).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

<p>
<b>Step 2.</b> Run <tt>ptex2tex</tt> (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; ptex2tex mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
In case you do not have <tt>ptex2tex</tt>, you may run a (very) simplified version:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Note that Doconce generates a <tt>.p.tex</tt> file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through <tt>-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional</tt>.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
<tt>-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage</tt>.

<p>
Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

<p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>BOOK</tt> for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 <li> <tt>PALATINO</tt> for the Palatino font
 <li> <tt>HELVETIA</tt> for the Helvetica font
 <li> <tt>A4PAPER</tt> for A4 paper size
 <li> <tt>A6PAPER</tt> for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 <li> <tt>MOVIE15</tt> for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 <li> <tt>PREAMBLE</tt> to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)
 <li> <tt>MINTED</tt> for inclusion of the minted package (which requires <tt>latex</tt>
   or <tt>pdflatex</tt> to be run with the <tt>-shell-escape</tt> option)
</ul>

The <tt>ptex2tex</tt> tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any <tt>!bc</tt> command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your <tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt>
file, e.g., <tt>!bc sys</tt> for a terminal session, where <tt>sys</tt> is set to
a certain environment in <tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt> (e.g., <tt>CodeTerminal</tt>).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

<p>
Also the <tt>doconce ptex2tex</tt> command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the <tt>.p.tex</tt> file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Note that <tt>@</tt> must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as <tt>minted</tt>
above, which implies <tt>\begin{minted}{fortran}</tt> and <tt>\end{minted}</tt> as
begin and end for blocks inside <tt>!bc fpro</tt> and <tt>!ec</tt>).  Specifying
<tt>envir=ans:nt</tt> means that all other environments are typeset with the
<tt>anslistings.sty</tt> package, e.g., <tt>!bc cppcod</tt> will then result in
<tt>\begin{c++}</tt>. If no environments like <tt>sys</tt>, <tt>fpro</tt>, or the common
<tt>envir</tt> are defined on the command line, the plain <tt>\begin{verbatim}</tt>
and <tt>\end{verbatim}</tt> used.

<p>

<p>
<b>Step 2b (optional).</b> Edit the <tt>mydoc.tex</tt> file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute <tt>section</tt> by <tt>section*</tt> to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the <tt>doconce replace</tt> and <tt>doconce subst</tt>
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal&gt; doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g&lt;1&gt; \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g&lt;2&gt;' mydoc.tex
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

<p>
<b>Step 3.</b> Compile <tt>mydoc.tex</tt>
and create the PDF file:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal&gt; bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal&gt; latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; dvipdf mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
If one wishes to run <tt>ptex2tex</tt> and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (<tt>Minted_Python</tt>, <tt>Minted_Cpp</tt>, etc., in
<tt>ptex2tex</tt> specified through the <tt>*pro</tt> and <tt>*cod</tt> variables in
<tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt> or <tt>$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg</tt>), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running <tt>ptex2tex</tt> with the
<tt>-DMINTED</tt> option:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
In this case, <tt>latex</tt> must be run with the
<tt>-shell-escape</tt> option:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal&gt; bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; dvipdf mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
When running <tt>doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted</tt> (or other minted
specifications with <tt>doconce ptex2tex</tt>), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the <tt>-DMINTED</tt> option.

<p>

<p>

<h3>PDFLaTeX  <a name="___sec9"></a></h3>
<p>
Running <tt>pdflatex</tt> instead of <tt>latex</tt> follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Then <tt>ptex2tex</tt> is run as explained above, and finally
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal&gt; bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal&gt; pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h3>Plain ASCII Text  <a name="___sec10"></a></h3>
<p>
We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h3>reStructuredText  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>
<p>
Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file <tt>mydoc.rst</tt>:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
We may now produce various other formats:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; rst2html.py  mydoc.rst &gt; mydoc.html # html
Terminal&gt; rst2latex.py mydoc.rst &gt; mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal&gt; rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst &gt; mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal&gt; rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst &gt; mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The OpenOffice file <tt>mydoc.odt</tt> can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program <tt>unovonv</tt>
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports <em>on the command line</em>.
Run
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; unoconv --show
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
<tt>mydoc.odt</tt> to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal&gt; unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal&gt; unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<b>Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.</b> At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by <tt>latex</tt> as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the <tt>sphinx</tt> output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

</ul>

<h3>Sphinx  <a name="___sec12"></a></h3>
<p>
Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the <tt>doconce sphinx_dir</tt> command:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The keywords <tt>author</tt>, <tt>title</tt>, and <tt>version</tt> are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, <tt>version</tt> is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files <tt>file1</tt>,
<tt>file2</tt>, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files <tt>file1</tt>, <tt>file2</tt>, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of <tt>dirname</tt> is <tt>sphinx-rootdir</tt>. The <tt>theme</tt>
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is <tt>'default'</tt>).

<p>
With a single-file document in <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt> one often just runs
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory <tt>sphinx-rootdir</tt> is made with
relevant files.

<p>
The <tt>doconce sphinx_dir</tt> command generates a script
<tt>automake_sphinx.py</tt> for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run <tt>automake_sphinx.py</tt> or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

<p>
The <tt>doconce sphinx_dir</tt> script copies directories named <tt>figs</tt> or
<tt>figures</tt> over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, <tt>automake_sphinx.py</tt> must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not <tt>http:</tt> or <tt>file:</tt> URLs), must be
placed in the <tt>_static</tt> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility <tt>doconce sphinxfix_localURLs</tt> is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say <tt>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</tt> it
replaces the link by <tt>_static/myfile.txt</tt> and copies
<tt>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</tt> to a local <tt>_static</tt> directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in <tt>_static</tt> or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all <tt>_static/*</tt> files to the
<tt>_static</tt> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a <tt>_static</tt> or <tt>_static-name</tt> directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

<p>
Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the <tt>conf.py</tt>
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
<tt>make-themes.sh</tt> can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes <tt>fenics</tt> and <tt>pyramid</tt>, one writes
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The resulting directories with HTML documents are <tt>_build/html_fenics</tt>
and <tt>_build/html_pyramid</tt>, respectively. Without arguments,
<tt>make-themes.sh</tt> makes all available themes (!).

<p>
If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt>.

<p>
<b>Step 1.</b> Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format sphinx mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<b>Step 2.</b> Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive <tt>sphinx-quickstart</tt>
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart &lt;&lt;EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The autogenerated <tt>conf.py</tt> file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The <tt>doconce sphinx_dir</tt> generator makes an extended <tt>conv.py</tt>
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.

<p>

<p>
<b>Step 3.</b> Copy the <tt>mydoc.rst</tt> file to the Sphinx root directory:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with <tt>mydoc.rst</tt> in the <tt>sphinx-rootdir</tt>
directory. Either edit <tt>mydoc.rst</tt> so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to <tt>sphinx-rootdir</tt>.
Links to local files in <tt>mydoc.rst</tt> must be modified to links to
files in the <tt>_static</tt> directory, see comment above.

<p>
<b>Step 4.</b> Edit the generated <tt>index.rst</tt> file so that <tt>mydoc.rst</tt>
is included, i.e., add <tt>mydoc</tt> to the <tt>toctree</tt> section so that it becomes
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
(The spaces before <tt>mydoc</tt> are important!)

<p>
<b>Step 5.</b> Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with <tt>index.html</tt> files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

<p>
<b>Step 6.</b> View the result:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; firefox _build/html/index.html
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows <tt>!bc</tt>: <tt>cod</tt> gives Python
(<tt>code-block:: python</tt> in Sphinx syntax) and <tt>cppcod</tt> gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Wiki Formats  <a name="___sec13"></a></h3>
<p>
There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax">Googlecode wiki</a>, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
<tt>gwiki</tt>, <tt>mwiki</tt>, and <tt>cwiki</tt>, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal&gt; doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal&gt; doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The Googlecode wiki document, <tt>mydoc.gwiki</tt>, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

<p>
When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the <tt>.gwiki</tt> file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

<p>
From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of <a href="http://pediapress.com/code/">mwlib</a>. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org">Wikibooks</a>
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Tweaking the Doconce Output  <a name="___sec14"></a></h3>
<p>
Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
<tt>.rst</tt> file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if <tt>.eps</tt> or <tt>.png</tt> is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The <tt>make.sh</tt> files in <tt>docs/manual</tt> and <tt>docs/tutorial</tt>
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Demos  <a name="___sec15"></a></h3>
<p>
The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The file <tt>make.sh</tt> in the <tt>tutorial</tt> directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, <tt>tutorial.do.txt</tt> is the
starting point.  Running <tt>make.sh</tt> and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original <tt>tutorial.do.txt</tt> file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
<a href="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html">Here</a>
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

<p>
There is another demo in the <tt>docs/manual</tt> directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, <tt>manual.do.txt</tt>, to
various formats. The <tt>make.sh</tt> script runs a set of translations.

<p>

<h2>Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies  <a name="___sec16"></a></h2>
<p>

<h3>Doconce  <a name="___sec17"></a></h3>
<p>
Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/doconce"><tt>http://code.google.com/p/doconce</tt></a>.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (<tt>hg</tt>) source follows the standard procedure:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get install doconce
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h3>Dependencies  <a name="___sec18"></a></h3>
<p>

<h4>Preprocessors  <a name="___sec19"></a></h4>
<p>
If you make use of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess">Preprocess</a>
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
<a href="http://www.makotemplates.org">Mako</a>. Its installation is most
conveniently done by <tt>pip</tt>,

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
pip install Mako
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This command requires <tt>pip</tt> to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-pip
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Alternatively, one can install from the <tt>pip</tt> <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">source code</a>.

<p>

<h4>Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output  <a name="___sec20"></a></h4>
<p>
To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex">ptex2tex</a>,
which is installed by

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, <tt>cp2texmf.sh</tt>:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that <tt>ptex2tex</tt> potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the <tt>~/texmf/tex/latex/misc</tt> directory).

<p>
Note that the <tt>doconce ptex2tex</tt> command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the <tt>ptex2tex</tt>
program.

<p>
The <em>minted</em> LaTeX style is offered by <tt>ptex2tex</tt> and <tt>doconce ptext2tex</tt>
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package <a href="http://pygments.org">Pygments</a>
to be installed:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
If you use the minted style together with <tt>ptex2tex</tt>, you have to
enable it by the <tt>-DMINTED</tt> command-line argument to <tt>ptex2tex</tt>.  All
use of the minted style requires the <tt>-shell-escape</tt> command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., <tt>latex -shell-escape</tt> or <tt>pdflatex
-shell-escape</tt>.

<p>
<!-- Say something about anslistings.sty -->

<p>

<h4>reStructuredText (reST) Output  <a name="___sec21"></a></h4>
<p>
The <tt>rst</tt> output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net">docutils</a> package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf">rst2pdf</a>. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the <tt>rst2pdf</tt> directory and
run the usual <tt>sudo python setup.py install</tt>.

<p>

<p>
Output to <tt>sphinx</tt> requires of course <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org">Sphinx</a>,
installed by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h4>Markdown and Pandoc Output  <a name="___sec22"></a></h4>
<p>
The Doconce format <tt>pandoc</tt> outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the <tt>pandoc</tt> program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get install pandoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h4>Epydoc Output  <a name="___sec23"></a></h4>
<p>
When the output format is <tt>epydoc</tt> one needs that program too, installed
by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<b>Remark.</b> Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
<tt>apt-get install</tt> command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For <tt>svn</tt> directories, go to the directory,
run <tt>svn update</tt>, and then <tt>sudo python setup.py install</tt>. For
Mercurial (<tt>hg</tt>) directories, go to the directory, run
<tt>hg pull; hg update</tt>, and then <tt>sudo python setup.py install</tt>.

\begin{itemize}
 \item When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, {\LaTeX}, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 \item Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like \href{{http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf}}{LaTeX}, \href{{http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/}}{HTML}, \href{{http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html}}{reStructuredText}, \href{{http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html}}{Sphinx}, and \href{{http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax}}{wiki}? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 \item Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?
\end{itemize}

\noindent
If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


\section{The Doconce Concept}

Doconce is two things:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, {\LaTeX}, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via \code{rst2*} programs) go to XML, HTML,
    {\LaTeX}, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via \code{unoconv}) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, {\LaTeX}, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

 \item Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Here are some Doconce features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    {\LaTeX} and HTML.

  \item Doconce can be converted to plain \emph{untagged} text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  \item Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.

  \item Doconce has full support for {\LaTeX} math and integrates well
    with big {\LaTeX} projects (books).

  \item Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, {\LaTeX}, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  \item Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in {\LaTeX}, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Large books written in {\LaTeX}, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  \item Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as {\LaTeX} integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  \item Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, {\LaTeX}, Sphinx, and similar
formats.


\section{What Does Doconce Look Like?}

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.

  \item \emph{Emphasized words} are surrounded by asterisks.

  \item \textbf{Words in boldface} are surrounded by underscores.

  \item Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset \code{verbatim (in a monospace font)}.

  \item Section headings are recognied by equality (\code{=}) signs before
    and after the title, and the number of \code{=} signs indicates the
    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and
    3 for subsubsection.

  \item Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading.

  \item The abstract of a document starts with \emph{Abstract} as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,

  \item Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    \code{!bc} (begin code) and \code{!ec} (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block.

  \item Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.

  \item Blocks of {\LaTeX} mathematics can easily be included by placing
    \code{!bt} (begin TeX) and \code{!et} (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block.

  \item There is support for both {\LaTeX} and text-like inline mathematics.

  \item Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.

  \item Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout
    the text.

  \item Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can
    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such
    comments).

  \item There is special support for advanced exercises features.

  \item With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text.

  \item With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
\bccq
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
\eccq
The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

\subsection{A Subsection with Sample Text}

\label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
\textbf{boldface} words, \emph{emphasized} words, and \code{computer} words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

\begin{itemize}
  \item item 1

  \item item 2

  \item item 3
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an \code{o}
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item item 1

 \item item 2

 \item item 3
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
URLs with a link word are possible, as in \href{{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}{hpl}.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in \href{{tutorial.do.txt}}{\nolinkurl{tutorial.do.txt}}.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section~\ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as \inlinecomment{hpl}{here I will make
some remarks to the text} for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section~\ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{rrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent

\subsection{Mathematics and Computer Code}

Inline mathematics, such as $\nu = \sin(x)$,
allows the formula to be specified both as {\LaTeX} and as plain text.
This results in a professional {\LaTeX} typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw {\LaTeX} mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like $\nu = \sin(x)$ is
typeset as
\bccq
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
\eccq
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between {\LaTeX} code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw {\LaTeX}, inside
\code{!bt} and \code{!et} (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for {\LaTeX} mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes \code{latex}, \code{pdflatex}, \code{html}, and \code{sphinx}). The raw
{\LaTeX} syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read {\LaTeX} syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
\code{!bc} and \code{!ec} instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like
\bcod
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
\ecod
A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to \code{sphinx}, \code{rst}, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., \code{!bc xxx}
where \code{xxx} is an identifier like \code{pycod} for code snippet in Python,
\code{sys} for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to {\LaTeX},
these identifiers are used as in \code{ptex2tex} and defined in a
configuration file \code{.ptext2tex.cfg}, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):
\bccq
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
\eccq
By default, \code{pro} and \code{cod} are \code{python}, \code{sys} is \code{console},
while \code{xpro} and \code{xcod} are computer language specific for \code{x}
in \code{f} (Fortran), \code{c} (C), \code{cpp} (C++), \code{pl} (Perl), \code{m} (Matlab),
\code{sh} (Unix shells), \code{cy} (Cython), and \code{py} (Python).

% (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code
% blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments
% and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the
% first one is used.)

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with \code{!bc pro}, while a part of a file is copied into a \code{!bc cod}
environment. What \code{pro} and \code{cod} mean is then defined through
a \code{.ptex2tex.cfg} file for {\LaTeX} and a \code{sphinx code-blocks}
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing \code{#include "mynote.do.txt"}
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension \code{do.txt}. The \code{do} part stands for doconce, while the
trailing \code{.txt} denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.

\subsection{Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography}

\label{newcommands}

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style \emph{newcommand}
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
\code{newcommand_replace.tex} are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for {\LaTeX} (since {\LaTeX} performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names \code{newcommands.tex} and
\code{newcommands_keep.tex} are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands {\LaTeX} math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
\code{!bt} and \code{!et} in \code{newcommands_keep.tex} to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw {\LaTeX} math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render {\LaTeX}.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
\code{newcommands_replace.tex} and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the \code{newcommands*.tex} files \emph{must} appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the {\LaTeX} and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of {\LaTeX},
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in {\LaTeX}
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the \code{doc/manual/manual.do.txt} file (see the
\href{{https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html}}{demo page}
for various formats of this document).


% Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess):


\section{From Doconce to Other Formats}

\label{doconce2formats}

Transformation of a Doconce document \code{mydoc.do.txt} to various other
formats applies the script \code{doconce format}:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
\esys
or just
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
\esys
The \code{mako} or \code{preprocess} programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to \code{mako} or \code{preprocess} can be added after the
filename. For example,
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
\esys
The variable \code{FORMAT} is always defined as the current format when
running \code{preprocess}. That is, in the last example, \code{FORMAT} is
defined as \code{latex}. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like \code{#if FORMAT == "latex"}.

The command-line arguments \code{--no-preprocess} and \code{--no-mako} turn off
running \code{preprocess} and \code{mako}, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
\esys
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
\bccq
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
\eccq
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

\subsection{HTML}

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file \code{mydoc.do.txt}
is performed by
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
\esys
The resulting file \code{mydoc.html} can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the \code{pygmentize} program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument \code{--no-pygments-html}
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain \code{<pre>} HTML tags. The option \code{--pygments-html-linenos} turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": \code{%(title)s} for a title,
\code{%(date)s} for a date, and \code{%(main)s} for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
\code{DATE:} line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert \code{%(title)s} and
\code{%(date)s} at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by \code{%(main)s}. Here is an example:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
\esys

\subsection{Pandoc and Markdown}

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
\esys
The name of the output file is \code{mydoc.mkd}.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
\bsys
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
\esys
Pandoc supports \code{latex}, \code{html}, \code{odt} (OpenOffice), \code{docx} (Microsoft
Word), \code{rtf}, \code{texinfo}, to mention some. The \code{-R} option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or {\LaTeX} to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the \code{--toc} option generates a table of contents.
See the \href{{http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html}}{Pandoc documentation}
for the many features of the \code{pandoc} program.

Pandoc is useful to go from {\LaTeX} mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
\code{doconce format pandoc} and then translating using \code{pandoc}, or
\code{doconce format latex}, and then going from {\LaTeX} to the desired format
using \code{pandoc}.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
\esys
When we go through \code{pandoc}, only single equations or \code{align*}
environments are well understood.

Quite some \code{doconce replace} and \code{doconce subst} edits might be needed
on the \code{.mkd} or \code{.tex} files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via {\LaTeX}.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
\esys
The \code{-s} option adds a proper header and footer to the \code{mydoc.html} file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

\subsection{{\LaTeX}}

Making a {\LaTeX} file \code{mydoc.tex} from \code{mydoc.do.txt} is done in two steps:
% Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many
% formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph
% environment, as used here.

\paragraph{Step 1.}
Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form \code{mydoc.p.tex} for
the \code{ptex2tex} program (or \code{doconce ptex2tex}):
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
\esys
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files \code{newcommands.tex}, \code{newcommands_keep.tex}, or
\code{newcommands_replace.tex} (see Section~\ref{newcommands}).
If these files are present, they are included in the {\LaTeX} document
so that your commands are defined.

\paragraph{Step 2.}
Run \code{ptex2tex} (if you have it) to make a standard {\LaTeX} file,
\bsys
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
\esys
In case you do not have \code{ptex2tex}, you may run a (very) simplified version:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
\esys

Note that Doconce generates a \code{.p.tex} file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the {\LaTeX} document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
\bsys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
\esys
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard {\LaTeX} "maketitle" heading
is also available through \code{-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional}.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
\code{-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage}.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

\begin{itemize}
 \item \code{BOOK} for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)

 \item \code{PALATINO} for the Palatino font

 \item \code{HELVETIA} for the Helvetica font

 \item \code{A4PAPER} for A4 paper size

 \item \code{A6PAPER} for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)

 \item \code{MOVIE15} for using the movie15 {\LaTeX} package to display movies

 \item \code{PREAMBLE} to turn the {\LaTeX} preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)

 \item \code{MINTED} for inclusion of the minted package (which requires \code{latex}
   or \code{pdflatex} to be run with the \code{-shell-escape} option)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The \code{ptex2tex} tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in {\LaTeX}
documents. After any \code{!bc} command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your \code{.ptex2tex.cfg}
file, e.g., \code{!bc sys} for a terminal session, where \code{sys} is set to
a certain environment in \code{.ptex2tex.cfg} (e.g., \code{CodeTerminal}).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the \code{doconce ptex2tex} command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the \code{.p.tex} file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
\esys
Note that \code{@} must be used to separate the begin and end {\LaTeX}
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as \code{minted}
above, which implies \code{\begin{minted}{fortran}} and \code{\end{minted}} as
begin and end for blocks inside \code{!bc fpro} and \code{!ec}).  Specifying
\code{envir=ans:nt} means that all other environments are typeset with the
\code{anslistings.sty} package, e.g., \code{!bc cppcod} will then result in
\code{\begin{c++}}. If no environments like \code{sys}, \code{fpro}, or the common
\code{envir} are defined on the command line, the plain \code{\begin{verbatim}}
and \code{\end{verbatim}} used.


\paragraph{Step 2b (optional).}
Edit the \code{mydoc.tex} file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute \code{section} by \code{section*} to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the \code{doconce replace} and \code{doconce subst}
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
\esys
A lot of tailored fixes to the {\LaTeX} document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the {\LaTeX} file.

\paragraph{Step 3.}
Compile \code{mydoc.tex}
and create the PDF file:
\bsys
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
\esys

If one wishes to run \code{ptex2tex} and use the minted {\LaTeX} package for
typesetting code blocks (\code{Minted_Python}, \code{Minted_Cpp}, etc., in
\code{ptex2tex} specified through the \code{*pro} and \code{*cod} variables in
\code{.ptex2tex.cfg} or \code{$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg}), the minted {\LaTeX} package is
needed.  This package is included by running \code{ptex2tex} with the
\code{-DMINTED} option:
\bsys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
\esys
In this case, \code{latex} must be run with the
\code{-shell-escape} option:
\bsys
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
\esys
When running \code{doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted} (or other minted
specifications with \code{doconce ptex2tex}), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the \code{-DMINTED} option.

\subsection{PDFLaTeX}

Running \code{pdflatex} instead of \code{latex} follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
\esys
Then \code{ptex2tex} is run as explained above, and finally
\bsys
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
\esys

\subsection{Plain ASCII Text}

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
\esys

\subsection{reStructuredText}

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file \code{mydoc.rst}:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
\esys
We may now produce various other formats:
\bsys
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
\esys

The OpenOffice file \code{mydoc.odt} can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program \code{unovonv}
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports \emph{on the command line}.
Run
\bsys
Terminal> unoconv --show
\esys
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
\code{mydoc.odt} to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
\bsys
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
\esys

\paragraph{Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.}
At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and {\LaTeX} mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by \code{latex} as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the \code{sphinx} output format.
Some links for going from {\LaTeX} to Word are listed below.

\end{itemize}

\noindent

\subsection{Sphinx}

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the \code{doconce sphinx_dir} command:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
\esys
The keywords \code{author}, \code{title}, and \code{version} are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, \code{version} is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files \code{file1},
\code{file2}, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files \code{file1}, \code{file2}, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of \code{dirname} is \code{sphinx-rootdir}. The \code{theme}
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is \code{'default'}).

With a single-file document in \code{mydoc.do.txt} one often just runs
\bsys
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
\esys
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory \code{sphinx-rootdir} is made with
relevant files.

The \code{doconce sphinx_dir} command generates a script
\code{automake_sphinx.py} for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run \code{automake_sphinx.py} or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The \code{doconce sphinx_dir} script copies directories named \code{figs} or
\code{figures} over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, \code{automake_sphinx.py} must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not \code{http:} or \code{file:} URLs), must be
placed in the \code{_static} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility \code{doconce sphinxfix_localURLs} is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say \code{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt} it
replaces the link by \code{_static/myfile.txt} and copies
\code{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt} to a local \code{_static} directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in \code{_static} or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all \code{_static/*} files to the
\code{_static} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a \code{_static} or \code{_static-name} directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the \code{conf.py}
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
\code{make-themes.sh} can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes \code{fenics} and \code{pyramid}, one writes
\bsys
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
\esys
The resulting directories with HTML documents are \code{_build/html_fenics}
and \code{_build/html_pyramid}, respectively. Without arguments,
\code{make-themes.sh} makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file \code{mydoc.do.txt}.

\paragraph{Step 1.}
Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
\esys

\paragraph{Step 2.}
Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive \code{sphinx-quickstart}
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
\bsys
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
\esys
The autogenerated \code{conf.py} file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The \code{doconce sphinx_dir} generator makes an extended \code{conv.py}
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


\paragraph{Step 3.}
Copy the \code{mydoc.rst} file to the Sphinx root directory:
\bsys
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
\esys
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with \code{mydoc.rst} in the \code{sphinx-rootdir}
directory. Either edit \code{mydoc.rst} so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to \code{sphinx-rootdir}.
Links to local files in \code{mydoc.rst} must be modified to links to
files in the \code{_static} directory, see comment above.

\paragraph{Step 4.}
Edit the generated \code{index.rst} file so that \code{mydoc.rst}
is included, i.e., add \code{mydoc} to the \code{toctree} section so that it becomes
\bccq
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
\eccq
(The spaces before \code{mydoc} are important!)

\paragraph{Step 5.}
Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
\bsys
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
\esys

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with \code{index.html} files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, {\LaTeX}, PDF (via {\LaTeX}), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

\paragraph{Step 6.}
View the result:
\bsys
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
\esys

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows \code{!bc}: \code{cod} gives Python
(\code{code-block:: python} in Sphinx syntax) and \code{cppcod} gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and {\LaTeX} output.

\subsection{Wiki Formats}

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
\href{{http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax}}{Googlecode wiki}, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
\code{gwiki}, \code{mwiki}, and \code{cwiki}, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
\esys

The Googlecode wiki document, \code{mydoc.gwiki}, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the \code{.gwiki} file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of \href{{http://pediapress.com/code/}}{mwlib}. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write \href{{http://en.wikibooks.org}}{Wikibooks}
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard {\LaTeX} book or a Sphinx web document.

\subsection{Tweaking the Doconce Output}

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
\code{.rst} file is going to be filtered to {\LaTeX} or HTML, it cannot know
if \code{.eps} or \code{.png} is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The \code{make.sh} files in \code{docs/manual} and \code{docs/tutorial}
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

\subsection{Demos}

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file
\bccq
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
\eccq
The file \code{make.sh} in the \code{tutorial} directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, \code{tutorial.do.txt} is the
starting point.  Running \code{make.sh} and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original \code{tutorial.do.txt} file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
\href{{https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html}}{Here}
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the \code{docs/manual} directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, \code{manual.do.txt}, to
various formats. The \code{make.sh} script runs a set of translations.


\section{Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies}

\subsection{Doconce}

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at \href{{http://code.google.com/p/doconce}}{\nolinkurl{http://code.google.com/p/doconce}}.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (\code{hg}) source follows the standard procedure:
\bsys
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
\esys
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
\bsys
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
\esys

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
\bsys
sudo apt-get install doconce
\esys
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
\bsys
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
\esys

\subsection{Dependencies}

\paragraph{Preprocessors.}
If you make use of the \href{{http://code.google.com/p/preprocess}}{Preprocess}
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

\bsys
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
\esys

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
\href{{http://www.makotemplates.org}}{Mako}. Its installation is most
conveniently done by \code{pip},

\bsys
pip install Mako
\esys
This command requires \code{pip} to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

\bsys
sudo apt-get install python-pip
\esys
Alternatively, one can install from the \code{pip} \href{{http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip}}{source code}.

\paragraph{Ptex2tex for {\LaTeX} Output.}
To make {\LaTeX} documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need \href{{http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex}}{ptex2tex},
which is installed by

\bsys
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
\esys
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, \code{cp2texmf.sh}:

\bsys
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
\esys
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that \code{ptex2tex} potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

\bsys
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
\esys
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the \code{~/texmf/tex/latex/misc} directory).

Note that the \code{doconce ptex2tex} command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the \code{ptex2tex}
program.

The \emph{minted} {\LaTeX} style is offered by \code{ptex2tex} and \code{doconce ptext2tex}
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package \href{{http://pygments.org}}{Pygments}
to be installed:
\bsys
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
\esys

If you use the minted style together with \code{ptex2tex}, you have to
enable it by the \code{-DMINTED} command-line argument to \code{ptex2tex}.  All
use of the minted style requires the \code{-shell-escape} command-line
argument when running {\LaTeX}, i.e., \code{latex -shell-escape} or \code{pdflatex
-shell-escape}.

% Say something about anslistings.sty

\paragraph{reStructuredText (reST) Output.}
The \code{rst} output from Doconce allows further transformation to {\LaTeX},
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the \href{{http://docutils.sourceforge.net}}{docutils} package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

\bsys
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
\esys
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
\bsys
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
\esys

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of {\LaTeX}. The enabling software is
\href{{http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf}}{rst2pdf}. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the \code{rst2pdf} directory and
run the usual \code{sudo python setup.py install}.


Output to \code{sphinx} requires of course \href{{http://sphinx.pocoo.org}}{Sphinx},
installed by
\bsys
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
\esys

\paragraph{Markdown and Pandoc Output.}
The Doconce format \code{pandoc} outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the \code{pandoc} program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of \href{{http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/}}{Pandoc}, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

\bsys
sudo apt-get install pandoc
\esys

\paragraph{Epydoc Output.}
When the output format is \code{epydoc} one needs that program too, installed
by
\bsys
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
\esys

\paragraph{Remark.}
Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
\code{apt-get install} command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For \code{svn} directories, go to the directory,
run \code{svn update}, and then \code{sudo python setup.py install}. For
Mercurial (\code{hg}) directories, go to the directory, run
\code{hg pull; hg update}, and then \code{sudo python setup.py install}.

Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
========================================

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen

:Date: Jan 32, 2100

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like `LaTeX <http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf>`_, `HTML <http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/>`_, `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_, `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>`_, and `wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


The Doconce Concept
===================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via ``rst2*`` programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via ``unoconv``) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



What Does Doconce Look Like?
============================

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.

  * Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.

  * *Emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks.

  * **Words in boldface** are surrounded by underscores.

  * Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset ``verbatim (in a monospace font)``.

  * Section headings are recognied by equality (``=``) signs before
    and after the title, and the number of ``=`` signs indicates the
    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and
    3 for subsubsection.

  * Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading.

  * The abstract of a document starts with *Abstract* as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,

  * Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    ``!bc`` (begin code) and ``!ec`` (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block.

  * Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.

  * Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    ``!bt`` (begin TeX) and ``!et`` (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block.

  * There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.

  * Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.

  * Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout
    the text.

  * Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can
    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such
    comments).

  * There is special support for advanced exercises features.

  * With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text.

  * With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format::


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

.. _my:first:sec:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
**boldface** words, *emphasized* words, and ``computer`` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1

  * item 2

  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an ``o``
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1

 2. item 2

 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in `<tutorial.do.txt>`_.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section `A Subsection with Sample Text`_.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as (**hpl**: here I will make
some remarks to the text) for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section `From Doconce to Other Formats`_ for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x),
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as::


        $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
``!bt`` and ``!et`` (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this::

        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``html``, and ``sphinx``). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
``!bc`` and ``!ec`` instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like::


        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to ``sphinx``, ``rst``, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., ``!bc xxx``
where ``xxx`` is an identifier like ``pycod`` for code snippet in Python,
``sys`` for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ``ptex2tex`` and defined in a
configuration file ``.ptext2tex.cfg``, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments)::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, ``pro`` and ``cod`` are ``python``, ``sys`` is ``console``,
while ``xpro`` and ``xcod`` are computer language specific for ``x``
in ``f`` (Fortran), ``c`` (C), ``cpp`` (C++), ``pl`` (Perl), ``m`` (Matlab),
``sh`` (Unix shells), ``cy`` (Cython), and ``py`` (Python).

.. (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code

.. blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments

.. and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the

.. first one is used.)


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with ``!bc pro``, while a part of a file is copied into a ``!bc cod``
environment. What ``pro`` and ``cod`` mean is then defined through
a ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` file for LaTeX and a ``sphinx code-blocks``
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing ``#include "mynote.do.txt"``
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension ``do.txt``. The ``do`` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing ``.txt`` denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


.. _newcommands:

Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
``newcommand_replace.tex`` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names ``newcommands.tex`` and
``newcommands_keep.tex`` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
``!bt`` and ``!et`` in ``newcommands_keep.tex`` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
``newcommands_replace.tex`` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the ``newcommands*.tex`` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the ``doc/manual/manual.do.txt`` file (see the
`demo page <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>`_
for various formats of this document).


.. Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess):



.. _doconce2formats:

From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document ``mydoc.do.txt`` to various other
formats applies the script ``doconce format``::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable ``FORMAT`` is always defined as the current format when
running ``preprocess``. That is, in the last example, ``FORMAT`` is
defined as ``latex``. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like ``#if FORMAT == "latex"``.

The command-line arguments ``--no-preprocess`` and ``--no-mako`` turn off
running ``preprocess`` and ``mako``, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file ``mydoc.html`` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the ``pygmentize`` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument ``--no-pygments-html``
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain ``<pre>`` HTML tags. The option ``--pygments-html-linenos`` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": ``%(title)s`` for a title,
``%(date)s`` for a date, and ``%(main)s`` for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
``DATE:`` line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert ``%(title)s`` and
``%(date)s`` at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by ``%(main)s``. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html


Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is ``mydoc.mkd``.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats::


        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd

Pandoc supports ``latex``, ``html``, ``odt`` (OpenOffice), ``docx`` (Microsoft
Word), ``rtf``, ``texinfo``, to mention some. The ``-R`` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the ``--toc`` option generates a table of contents.
See the `Pandoc documentation <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html>`_
for the many features of the ``pandoc`` program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
``doconce format pandoc`` and then translating using ``pandoc``, or
``doconce format latex``, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using ``pandoc``.
Here is an example on the latter strategy::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through ``pandoc``, only single equations or ``align*``
environments are well understood.

Quite some ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst`` edits might be needed
on the ``.mkd`` or ``.tex`` files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd

The ``-s`` option adds a proper header and footer to the ``mydoc.html`` file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file ``mydoc.tex`` from ``mydoc.do.txt`` is done in two steps:
.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many

.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph

.. environment, as used here.


*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form ``mydoc.p.tex`` for
the ``ptex2tex`` program (or ``doconce ptex2tex``)::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files ``newcommands.tex``, ``newcommands_keep.tex``, or
``newcommands_replace.tex`` (see the section `Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography`_).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ``ptex2tex`` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have ``ptex2tex``, you may run a (very) simplified version::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc


Note that Doconce generates a ``.p.tex`` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through ``-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional``.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
``-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage``.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 * ``BOOK`` for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)

 * ``PALATINO`` for the Palatino font

 * ``HELVETIA`` for the Helvetica font

 * ``A4PAPER`` for A4 paper size

 * ``A6PAPER`` for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)

 * ``MOVIE15`` for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies

 * ``PREAMBLE`` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)

 * ``MINTED`` for inclusion of the minted package (which requires ``latex``
   or ``pdflatex`` to be run with the ``-shell-escape`` option)

The ``ptex2tex`` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any ``!bc`` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
file, e.g., ``!bc sys`` for a terminal session, where ``sys`` is set to
a certain environment in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` (e.g., ``CodeTerminal``).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the ``doconce ptex2tex`` command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the ``.p.tex`` file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
                  -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that ``@`` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as ``minted``
above, which implies ``\begin{minted}{fortran}`` and ``\end{minted}`` as
begin and end for blocks inside ``!bc fpro`` and ``!ec``).  Specifying
``envir=ans:nt`` means that all other environments are typeset with the
``anslistings.sty`` package, e.g., ``!bc cppcod`` will then result in
``\begin{c++}``. If no environments like ``sys``, ``fpro``, or the common
``envir`` are defined on the command line, the plain ``\begin{verbatim}``
and ``\end{verbatim}`` used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the ``mydoc.tex`` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute ``section`` by ``section*`` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst``
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples::


        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile ``mydoc.tex``
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc


If one wishes to run ``ptex2tex`` and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (``Minted_Python``, ``Minted_Cpp``, etc., in
``ptex2tex`` specified through the ``*pro`` and ``*cod`` variables in
``.ptex2tex.cfg`` or ``$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg``), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running ``ptex2tex`` with the
``-DMINTED`` option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, ``latex`` must be run with the
``-shell-escape`` option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

When running ``doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted`` (or other minted
specifications with ``doconce ptex2tex``), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the ``-DMINTED`` option.


PDFLaTeX
--------

Running ``pdflatex`` instead of ``latex`` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then ``ptex2tex`` is run as explained above, and finally::


        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file ``mydoc.rst``::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice


The OpenOffice file ``mydoc.odt`` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program ``unovonv``
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run::


        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
``mydoc.odt`` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF::


        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt


*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by ``latex`` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the ``sphinx`` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords ``author``, ``title``, and ``version`` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, ``version`` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files ``file1``,
``file2``, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files ``file1``, ``file2``, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of ``dirname`` is ``sphinx-rootdir``. The ``theme``
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ``'default'``).

With a single-file document in ``mydoc.do.txt`` one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory ``sphinx-rootdir`` is made with
relevant files.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command generates a script
``automake_sphinx.py`` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run ``automake_sphinx.py`` or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` script copies directories named ``figs`` or
``figures`` over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, ``automake_sphinx.py`` must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not ``http:`` or ``file:`` URLs), must be
placed in the ``_static`` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility ``doconce sphinxfix_localURLs`` is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say ``dir1/dir2/myfile.txt`` it
replaces the link by ``_static/myfile.txt`` and copies
``dir1/dir2/myfile.txt`` to a local ``_static`` directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in ``_static`` or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all ``_static/*`` files to the
``_static`` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a ``_static`` or ``_static-name`` directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the ``conf.py``
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
``make-themes.sh`` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes ``fenics`` and ``pyramid``, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are ``_build/html_fenics``
and ``_build/html_pyramid``, respectively. Without arguments,
``make-themes.sh`` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file ``mydoc.do.txt``.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive ``sphinx-quickstart``
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated ``conf.py`` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` generator makes an extended ``conv.py``
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the ``mydoc.rst`` file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with ``mydoc.rst`` in the ``sphinx-rootdir``
directory. Either edit ``mydoc.rst`` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to ``sphinx-rootdir``.
Links to local files in ``mydoc.rst`` must be modified to links to
files in the ``_static`` directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated ``index.rst`` file so that ``mydoc.rst``
is included, i.e., add ``mydoc`` to the ``toctree`` section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before ``mydoc`` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with ``index.html`` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows ``!bc``: ``cod`` gives Python
(``code-block:: python`` in Sphinx syntax) and ``cppcod`` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
`Googlecode wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
``gwiki``, ``mwiki``, and ``cwiki``, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt


The Googlecode wiki document, ``mydoc.gwiki``, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the ``.gwiki`` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of `mwlib <http://pediapress.com/code/>`_. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write `Wikibooks <http://en.wikibooks.org>`_
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
``.rst`` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if ``.eps`` or ``.png`` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The ``make.sh`` files in ``docs/manual`` and ``docs/tutorial``
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file ``make.sh`` in the ``tutorial`` directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, ``tutorial.do.txt`` is the
starting point.  Running ``make.sh`` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original ``tutorial.do.txt`` file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
`Here <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>`_
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the ``docs/manual`` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, ``manual.do.txt``, to
various formats. The ``make.sh`` script runs a set of translations.

Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies
============================================

Doconce
-------

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at `<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>`_.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (``hg``) source follows the standard procedure::


        # Doconce
        hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version::


        cd doconce
        hg pull
        hg update
        sudo python setup.py install


Debian GNU/Linux users can also run::


        sudo apt-get install doconce

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run::


        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install doconce


Dependencies
------------

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the `Preprocess <http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_
preprocessor, this program must be installed::


        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
`Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org>`_. Its installation is most
conveniently done by ``pip``::


        pip install Mako

This command requires ``pip`` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by::


        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the ``pip`` `source code <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_.

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_,
which is installed by::


        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, ``cp2texmf.sh``::


        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that ``ptex2tex`` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by::


        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the ``~/texmf/tex/latex/misc`` directory).

Note that the ``doconce ptex2tex`` command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the ``ptex2tex``
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by ``ptex2tex`` and ``doconce ptext2tex``
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package `Pygments <http://pygments.org>`_
to be installed::


        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install


If you use the minted style together with ``ptex2tex``, you have to
enable it by the ``-DMINTED`` command-line argument to ``ptex2tex``.  All
use of the minted style requires the ``-shell-escape`` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., ``latex -shell-escape`` or ``pdflatex
-shell-escape``.

.. Say something about anslistings.sty


reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rst`` output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by::


        svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install::


        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths


There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
`rst2pdf <http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf>`_. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the ``rst2pdf`` directory and
run the usual ``sudo python setup.py install``.


Output to ``sphinx`` requires of course `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_,
installed by::


        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce format ``pandoc`` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the ``pandoc`` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by::


        sudo apt-get install pandoc


Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is ``epydoc`` one needs that program too, installed
by::


        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..


*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
``apt-get install`` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For ``svn`` directories, go to the directory,
run ``svn update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``. For
Mercurial (``hg``) directories, go to the directory, run
``hg pull; hg update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``.

Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
========================================

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen

:Date: Jan 32, 2100

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like `LaTeX <http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf>`_, `HTML <http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/>`_, `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_, `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>`_, and `wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


The Doconce Concept
===================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via ``rst2*`` programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via ``unoconv``) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



What Does Doconce Look Like?
============================

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.

  * Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.

  * *Emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks.

  * **Words in boldface** are surrounded by underscores.

  * Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset ``verbatim (in a monospace font)``.

  * Section headings are recognied by equality (``=``) signs before
    and after the title, and the number of ``=`` signs indicates the
    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and
    3 for subsubsection.

  * Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading.

  * The abstract of a document starts with *Abstract* as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,

  * Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    ``!bc`` (begin code) and ``!ec`` (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block.

  * Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.

  * Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    ``!bt`` (begin TeX) and ``!et`` (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block.

  * There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.

  * Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.

  * Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout
    the text.

  * Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can
    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such
    comments).

  * There is special support for advanced exercises features.

  * With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text.

  * With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:

.. code-block:: py


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

.. _my:first:sec:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
**boldface** words, *emphasized* words, and ``computer`` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1

  * item 2

  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an ``o``
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1

 2. item 2

 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in `<tutorial.do.txt>`_.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section :ref:`my:first:sec`.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as (**hpl**: here I will make
some remarks to the text) for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section :ref:`doconce2formats` for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624

Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as :math:`\nu = \sin(x)`,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like :math:`\nu = \sin(x)` is
typeset as

.. code-block:: py


        $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
``!bt`` and ``!et`` (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:

.. math::
   :label: myeq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes ``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``html``, and ``sphinx``). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
``!bc`` and ``!ec`` instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like

.. code-block:: python

        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to ``sphinx``, ``rst``, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., ``!bc xxx``
where ``xxx`` is an identifier like ``pycod`` for code snippet in Python,
``sys`` for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ``ptex2tex`` and defined in a
configuration file ``.ptext2tex.cfg``, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):

.. code-block:: py


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, ``pro`` and ``cod`` are ``python``, ``sys`` is ``console``,
while ``xpro`` and ``xcod`` are computer language specific for ``x``
in ``f`` (Fortran), ``c`` (C), ``cpp`` (C++), ``pl`` (Perl), ``m`` (Matlab),
``sh`` (Unix shells), ``cy`` (Cython), and ``py`` (Python).

.. (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code

.. blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments

.. and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the

.. first one is used.)


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with ``!bc pro``, while a part of a file is copied into a ``!bc cod``
environment. What ``pro`` and ``cod`` mean is then defined through
a ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` file for LaTeX and a ``sphinx code-blocks``
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing ``#include "mynote.do.txt"``
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension ``do.txt``. The ``do`` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing ``.txt`` denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


.. _newcommands:

Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
``newcommand_replace.tex`` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names ``newcommands.tex`` and
``newcommands_keep.tex`` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
``!bt`` and ``!et`` in ``newcommands_keep.tex`` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
``newcommands_replace.tex`` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the ``newcommands*.tex`` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the ``doc/manual/manual.do.txt`` file (see the
`demo page <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>`_
for various formats of this document).


.. Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess):



.. _doconce2formats:

From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document ``mydoc.do.txt`` to various other
formats applies the script ``doconce format``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` can be added after the
filename. For example,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable ``FORMAT`` is always defined as the current format when
running ``preprocess``. That is, in the last example, ``FORMAT`` is
defined as ``latex``. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like ``#if FORMAT == "latex"``.

The command-line arguments ``--no-preprocess`` and ``--no-mako`` turn off
running ``preprocess`` and ``mako``, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:

.. code-block:: py


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is performed by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file ``mydoc.html`` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the ``pygmentize`` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument ``--no-pygments-html``
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain ``<pre>`` HTML tags. The option ``--pygments-html-linenos`` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": ``%(title)s`` for a title,
``%(date)s`` for a date, and ``%(main)s`` for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
``DATE:`` line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert ``%(title)s`` and
``%(date)s`` at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by ``%(main)s``. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html


Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is ``mydoc.mkd``.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd

Pandoc supports ``latex``, ``html``, ``odt`` (OpenOffice), ``docx`` (Microsoft
Word), ``rtf``, ``texinfo``, to mention some. The ``-R`` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the ``--toc`` option generates a table of contents.
See the `Pandoc documentation <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html>`_
for the many features of the ``pandoc`` program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
``doconce format pandoc`` and then translating using ``pandoc``, or
``doconce format latex``, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using ``pandoc``.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through ``pandoc``, only single equations or ``align*``
environments are well understood.

Quite some ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst`` edits might be needed
on the ``.mkd`` or ``.tex`` files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd

The ``-s`` option adds a proper header and footer to the ``mydoc.html`` file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file ``mydoc.tex`` from ``mydoc.do.txt`` is done in two steps:
.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many

.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph

.. environment, as used here.


*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form ``mydoc.p.tex`` for
the ``ptex2tex`` program (or ``doconce ptex2tex``):

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files ``newcommands.tex``, ``newcommands_keep.tex``, or
``newcommands_replace.tex`` (see the section :ref:`newcommands`).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ``ptex2tex`` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have ``ptex2tex``, you may run a (very) simplified version:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc


Note that Doconce generates a ``.p.tex`` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through ``-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional``.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
``-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage``.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 * ``BOOK`` for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)

 * ``PALATINO`` for the Palatino font

 * ``HELVETIA`` for the Helvetica font

 * ``A4PAPER`` for A4 paper size

 * ``A6PAPER`` for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)

 * ``MOVIE15`` for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies

 * ``PREAMBLE`` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)

 * ``MINTED`` for inclusion of the minted package (which requires ``latex``
   or ``pdflatex`` to be run with the ``-shell-escape`` option)

The ``ptex2tex`` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any ``!bc`` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
file, e.g., ``!bc sys`` for a terminal session, where ``sys`` is set to
a certain environment in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` (e.g., ``CodeTerminal``).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the ``doconce ptex2tex`` command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the ``.p.tex`` file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
                  -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that ``@`` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as ``minted``
above, which implies ``\begin{minted}{fortran}`` and ``\end{minted}`` as
begin and end for blocks inside ``!bc fpro`` and ``!ec``).  Specifying
``envir=ans:nt`` means that all other environments are typeset with the
``anslistings.sty`` package, e.g., ``!bc cppcod`` will then result in
``\begin{c++}``. If no environments like ``sys``, ``fpro``, or the common
``envir`` are defined on the command line, the plain ``\begin{verbatim}``
and ``\end{verbatim}`` used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the ``mydoc.tex`` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute ``section`` by ``section*`` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst``
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile ``mydoc.tex``
and create the PDF file:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc


If one wishes to run ``ptex2tex`` and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (``Minted_Python``, ``Minted_Cpp``, etc., in
``ptex2tex`` specified through the ``*pro`` and ``*cod`` variables in
``.ptex2tex.cfg`` or ``$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg``), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running ``ptex2tex`` with the
``-DMINTED`` option:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, ``latex`` must be run with the
``-shell-escape`` option:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

When running ``doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted`` (or other minted
specifications with ``doconce ptex2tex``), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the ``-DMINTED`` option.


PDFLaTeX
--------

Running ``pdflatex`` instead of ``latex`` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then ``ptex2tex`` is run as explained above, and finally

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file ``mydoc.rst``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice


The OpenOffice file ``mydoc.odt`` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program ``unovonv``
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
``mydoc.odt`` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt


*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by ``latex`` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the ``sphinx`` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

 * `<http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1033441>`_

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords ``author``, ``title``, and ``version`` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, ``version`` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files ``file1``,
``file2``, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files ``file1``, ``file2``, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of ``dirname`` is ``sphinx-rootdir``. The ``theme``
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ``'default'``).

With a single-file document in ``mydoc.do.txt`` one often just runs

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory ``sphinx-rootdir`` is made with
relevant files.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command generates a script
``automake_sphinx.py`` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run ``automake_sphinx.py`` or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` script copies directories named ``figs`` or
``figures`` over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, ``automake_sphinx.py`` must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not ``http:`` or ``file:`` URLs), must be
placed in the ``_static`` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility ``doconce sphinxfix_localURLs`` is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say ``dir1/dir2/myfile.txt`` it
replaces the link by ``_static/myfile.txt`` and copies
``dir1/dir2/myfile.txt`` to a local ``_static`` directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in ``_static`` or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all ``_static/*`` files to the
``_static`` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a ``_static`` or ``_static-name`` directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the ``conf.py``
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
``make-themes.sh`` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes ``fenics`` and ``pyramid``, one writes

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are ``_build/html_fenics``
and ``_build/html_pyramid``, respectively. Without arguments,
``make-themes.sh`` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file ``mydoc.do.txt``.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive ``sphinx-quickstart``
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:

.. code-block:: console

        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated ``conf.py`` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` generator makes an extended ``conv.py``
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the ``mydoc.rst`` file to the Sphinx root directory:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with ``mydoc.rst`` in the ``sphinx-rootdir``
directory. Either edit ``mydoc.rst`` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to ``sphinx-rootdir``.
Links to local files in ``mydoc.rst`` must be modified to links to
files in the ``_static`` directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated ``index.rst`` file so that ``mydoc.rst``
is included, i.e., add ``mydoc`` to the ``toctree`` section so that it becomes

.. code-block:: py


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before ``mydoc`` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:

.. code-block:: console

        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with ``index.html`` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows ``!bc``: ``cod`` gives Python
(``code-block:: python`` in Sphinx syntax) and ``cppcod`` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
`Googlecode wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
``gwiki``, ``mwiki``, and ``cwiki``, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt


The Googlecode wiki document, ``mydoc.gwiki``, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the ``.gwiki`` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of `mwlib <http://pediapress.com/code/>`_. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write `Wikibooks <http://en.wikibooks.org>`_
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
``.rst`` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if ``.eps`` or ``.png`` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The ``make.sh`` files in ``docs/manual`` and ``docs/tutorial``
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file

.. code-block:: py


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file ``make.sh`` in the ``tutorial`` directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, ``tutorial.do.txt`` is the
starting point.  Running ``make.sh`` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original ``tutorial.do.txt`` file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
`Here <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>`_
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the ``docs/manual`` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, ``manual.do.txt``, to
various formats. The ``make.sh`` script runs a set of translations.

Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies
============================================

Doconce
-------

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at `<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>`_.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (``hg``) source follows the standard procedure:

.. code-block:: console

        # Doconce
        hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:

.. code-block:: console

        cd doconce
        hg pull
        hg update
        sudo python setup.py install


Debian GNU/Linux users can also run

.. code-block:: console

        sudo apt-get install doconce

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run

.. code-block:: console

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install doconce


Dependencies
------------

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the `Preprocess <http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_
preprocessor, this program must be installed:


.. code-block:: console

        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
`Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org>`_. Its installation is most
conveniently done by ``pip``,


.. code-block:: console

        pip install Mako

This command requires ``pip`` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by


.. code-block:: console

        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the ``pip`` `source code <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_.

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_,
which is installed by


.. code-block:: console

        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, ``cp2texmf.sh``:


.. code-block:: console

        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that ``ptex2tex`` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by


.. code-block:: console

        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the ``~/texmf/tex/latex/misc`` directory).

Note that the ``doconce ptex2tex`` command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the ``ptex2tex``
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by ``ptex2tex`` and ``doconce ptext2tex``
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package `Pygments <http://pygments.org>`_
to be installed:

.. code-block:: console

        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install


If you use the minted style together with ``ptex2tex``, you have to
enable it by the ``-DMINTED`` command-line argument to ``ptex2tex``.  All
use of the minted style requires the ``-shell-escape`` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., ``latex -shell-escape`` or ``pdflatex
-shell-escape``.

.. Say something about anslistings.sty


reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rst`` output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by


.. code-block:: console

        svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install

.. code-block:: console

        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths


There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
`rst2pdf <http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf>`_. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the ``rst2pdf`` directory and
run the usual ``sudo python setup.py install``.


Output to ``sphinx`` requires of course `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_,
installed by

.. code-block:: console

        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce format ``pandoc`` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the ``pandoc`` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by


.. code-block:: console

        sudo apt-get install pandoc


Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is ``epydoc`` one needs that program too, installed
by

.. code-block:: console

        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..


*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
``apt-get install`` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For ``svn`` directories, go to the directory,
run ``svn update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``. For
Mercurial (``hg``) directories, go to the directory, run
``hg pull; hg update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``.

#summary Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere

By *Hans Petter Langtangen*

==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage   eventually go with a particular format?
 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various   formats like [http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf LaTeX], [http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/ HTML], [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html reStructuredText], [http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html Sphinx], and [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax wiki]? Would it be convenient   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?
 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.



== The Doconce Concept ==

Doconce is two things:


 # Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,    emails). From reST you can (via `rst2*` programs) go to XML, HTML,    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via `unoconv`) to    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.
 # Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:


  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than    LaTeX and HTML.
  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code    directly from the source code files via regular expressions    for the start and end lines.
  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:


  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



== What Does Doconce Look Like? ==

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.


  * Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.
  * *Emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks.
  * *Words in boldface* are surrounded by underscores.
  * Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and    then typeset `verbatim (in a monospace font)`.
  * Section headings are recognied by equality (`=`) signs before    and after the title, and the number of `=` signs indicates the    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and    3 for subsubsection.
  * Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore    before and after the heading.
  * The abstract of a document starts with *Abstract* as paragraph    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,
  * Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing    `!bc` (begin code) and `!ec` (end code) commands at separate lines    before and after the code block.
  * Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.
  * Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing    `!bt` (begin TeX) and `!et` (end TeX) commands at separate lines    before and after the math block.
  * There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.
  * Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.
  * Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout    the text.
  * Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such    comments).
  * There is special support for advanced exercises features.
  * With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined    in or out of the text.
  * With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
{{{
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
}}}
The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

==== A Subsection with Sample Text ====

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
*boldface* words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,


  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an `o`
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:


 # item 1
 # item 2
 # item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl].
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in tutorial.do.txt.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section [#A_Subsection_with_Sample_Text].

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats] for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,


 ||      *time*       ||    *velocity*     ||  *acceleration*   ||
 ||  0.0              ||  1.4186           ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  2.0              ||  1.376512         ||  11.919           ||
 ||  4.0              ||  1.1E+1           ||  14.717624        ||

==== Mathematics and Computer Code ====

Inline mathematics, such as `v = sin(x)`,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like `v = sin(x)` is
typeset as
{{{
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
}}}
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
`!bt` and `!et` (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
{{{
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
}}}
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes `latex`, `pdflatex`, `html`, and `sphinx`). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
`!bc` and `!ec` instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like
{{{
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
}}}
A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to `sphinx`, `rst`, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., `!bc xxx`
where `xxx` is an identifier like `pycod` for code snippet in Python,
`sys` for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in `ptex2tex` and defined in a
configuration file `.ptext2tex.cfg`, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
By default, `pro` and `cod` are `python`, `sys` is `console`,
while `xpro` and `xcod` are computer language specific for `x`
in `f` (Fortran), `c` (C), `cpp` (C++), `pl` (Perl), `m` (Matlab),
`sh` (Unix shells), `cy` (Cython), and `py` (Python).

<wiki:comment> (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> first one is used.) </wiki:comment>

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with `!bc pro`, while a part of a file is copied into a `!bc cod`
environment. What `pro` and `cod` mean is then defined through
a `.ptex2tex.cfg` file for LaTeX and a `sphinx code-blocks`
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing `#include "mynote.do.txt"`
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension `do.txt`. The `do` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing `.txt` denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.

==== Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography ====

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the `doc/manual/manual.do.txt` file (see the
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html demo page]
for various formats of this document).


<wiki:comment> Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess): </wiki:comment>



== From Doconce to Other Formats ==

Transformation of a Doconce document `mydoc.do.txt` to various other
formats applies the script `doconce format`:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
}}}
or just
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
}}}
The `mako` or `preprocess` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to `mako` or `preprocess` can be added after the
filename. For example,
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
}}}
The variable `FORMAT` is always defined as the current format when
running `preprocess`. That is, in the last example, `FORMAT` is
defined as `latex`. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like `#if FORMAT == "latex"`.

The command-line arguments `--no-preprocess` and `--no-mako` turn off
running `preprocess` and `mako`, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
}}}
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
{{{
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
}}}
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

==== HTML ====

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file `mydoc.do.txt`
is performed by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
}}}
The resulting file `mydoc.html` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the `pygmentize` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument `--no-pygments-html`
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain `<pre>` HTML tags. The option `--pygments-html-linenos` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": `%(title)s` for a title,
`%(date)s` for a date, and `%(main)s` for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
`DATE:` line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert `%(title)s` and
`%(date)s` at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by `%(main)s`. Here is an example:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
}}}

==== Pandoc and Markdown ====

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
{{{
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
}}}
The name of the output file is `mydoc.mkd`.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
{{{
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
}}}
Pandoc supports `latex`, `html`, `odt` (OpenOffice), `docx` (Microsoft
Word), `rtf`, `texinfo`, to mention some. The `-R` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the `--toc` option generates a table of contents.
See the [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html Pandoc documentation]
for the many features of the `pandoc` program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
`doconce format pandoc` and then translating using `pandoc`, or
`doconce format latex`, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using `pandoc`.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
}}}
When we go through `pandoc`, only single equations or `align*`
environments are well understood.

Quite some `doconce replace` and `doconce subst` edits might be needed
on the `.mkd` or `.tex` files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
}}}
The `-s` option adds a proper header and footer to the `mydoc.html` file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

==== LaTeX ====

Making a LaTeX file `mydoc.tex` from `mydoc.do.txt` is done in two steps:
<wiki:comment> Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> environment, as used here. </wiki:comment>

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form `mydoc.p.tex` for
the `ptex2tex` program (or `doconce ptex2tex`):
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
}}}
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files `newcommands.tex`, `newcommands_keep.tex`, or
`newcommands_replace.tex` (see the section [#Macros_(Newcommands),_Cross-References,_Index,_and_Bibliography]).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run `ptex2tex` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
}}}
In case you do not have `ptex2tex`, you may run a (very) simplified version:
{{{
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
}}}

Note that Doconce generates a `.p.tex` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
}}}
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through `-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional`.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
`-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage`.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are


 * `BOOK` for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 * `PALATINO` for the Palatino font
 * `HELVETIA` for the Helvetica font
 * `A4PAPER` for A4 paper size
 * `A6PAPER` for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 * `MOVIE15` for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 * `PREAMBLE` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document   or document to be included elsewhere)
 * `MINTED` for inclusion of the minted package (which requires `latex`   or `pdflatex` to be run with the `-shell-escape` option)

The `ptex2tex` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any `!bc` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your `.ptex2tex.cfg`
file, e.g., `!bc sys` for a terminal session, where `sys` is set to
a certain environment in `.ptex2tex.cfg` (e.g., `CodeTerminal`).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the `doconce ptex2tex` command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the `.p.tex` file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
{{{
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
}}}
Note that `@` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as `minted`
above, which implies `\begin{minted}{fortran}` and `\end{minted}` as
begin and end for blocks inside `!bc fpro` and `!ec`).  Specifying
`envir=ans:nt` means that all other environments are typeset with the
`anslistings.sty` package, e.g., `!bc cppcod` will then result in
`\begin{c++}`. If no environments like `sys`, `fpro`, or the common
`envir` are defined on the command line, the plain `\begin{verbatim}`
and `\end{verbatim}` used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the `mydoc.tex` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute `section` by `section*` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst`
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
{{{
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
}}}
A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile `mydoc.tex`
and create the PDF file:
{{{
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}

If one wishes to run `ptex2tex` and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (`Minted_Python`, `Minted_Cpp`, etc., in
`ptex2tex` specified through the `*pro` and `*cod` variables in
`.ptex2tex.cfg` or `$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg`), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running `ptex2tex` with the
`-DMINTED` option:
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
}}}
In this case, `latex` must be run with the
`-shell-escape` option:
{{{
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}
When running `doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted` (or other minted
specifications with `doconce ptex2tex`), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the `-DMINTED` option.

==== PDFLaTeX ====

Running `pdflatex` instead of `latex` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
}}}
Then `ptex2tex` is run as explained above, and finally
{{{
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
}}}

==== Plain ASCII Text ====

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
}}}

==== reStructuredText ====

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file `mydoc.rst`:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
}}}
We may now produce various other formats:
{{{
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
}}}

The OpenOffice file `mydoc.odt` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program `unovonv`
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run
{{{
Terminal> unoconv --show
}}}
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
`mydoc.odt` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
{{{
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
}}}

*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by `latex` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the `sphinx` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

==== Sphinx ====

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the `doconce sphinx_dir` command:
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
}}}
The keywords `author`, `title`, and `version` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, `version` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files `file1`,
`file2`, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files `file1`, `file2`, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of `dirname` is `sphinx-rootdir`. The `theme`
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is `'default'`).

With a single-file document in `mydoc.do.txt` one often just runs
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
}}}
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory `sphinx-rootdir` is made with
relevant files.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` command generates a script
`automake_sphinx.py` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run `automake_sphinx.py` or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` script copies directories named `figs` or
`figures` over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, `automake_sphinx.py` must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not `http:` or `file:` URLs), must be
placed in the `_static` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility `doconce sphinxfix_localURLs` is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say `dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` it
replaces the link by `_static/myfile.txt` and copies
`dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` to a local `_static` directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in `_static` or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all `_static/*` files to the
`_static` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a `_static` or `_static-name` directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the `conf.py`
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
`make-themes.sh` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes `fenics` and `pyramid`, one writes
{{{
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
}}}
The resulting directories with HTML documents are `_build/html_fenics`
and `_build/html_pyramid`, respectively. Without arguments,
`make-themes.sh` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file `mydoc.do.txt`.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
}}}

*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive `sphinx-quickstart`
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
{{{
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
}}}
The autogenerated `conf.py` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The `doconce sphinx_dir` generator makes an extended `conv.py`
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the `mydoc.rst` file to the Sphinx root directory:
{{{
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
}}}
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with `mydoc.rst` in the `sphinx-rootdir`
directory. Either edit `mydoc.rst` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to `sphinx-rootdir`.
Links to local files in `mydoc.rst` must be modified to links to
files in the `_static` directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated `index.rst` file so that `mydoc.rst`
is included, i.e., add `mydoc` to the `toctree` section so that it becomes
{{{
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
}}}
(The spaces before `mydoc` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
{{{
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
}}}

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with `index.html` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result:
{{{
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
}}}

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows `!bc`: `cod` gives Python
(`code-block:: python` in Sphinx syntax) and `cppcod` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

==== Wiki Formats ====

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
[http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax Googlecode wiki], MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
`gwiki`, `mwiki`, and `cwiki`, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
}}}

The Googlecode wiki document, `mydoc.gwiki`, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the `.gwiki` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of [http://pediapress.com/code/ mwlib]. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write [http://en.wikibooks.org Wikibooks]
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.

==== Tweaking the Doconce Output ====

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
`.rst` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if `.eps` or `.png` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The `make.sh` files in `docs/manual` and `docs/tutorial`
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

==== Demos ====

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file
{{{
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
}}}
The file `make.sh` in the `tutorial` directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, `tutorial.do.txt` is the
starting point.  Running `make.sh` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original `tutorial.do.txt` file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html Here]
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the `docs/manual` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, `manual.do.txt`, to
various formats. The `make.sh` script runs a set of translations.



== Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies ==

==== Doconce ====

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at http://code.google.com/p/doconce.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (`hg`) source follows the standard procedure:
{{{
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
{{{
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
{{{
sudo apt-get install doconce
}}}
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
{{{
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
}}}

==== Dependencies ====

==== Preprocessors ====

If you make use of the [http://code.google.com/p/preprocess Preprocess]
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

{{{
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
[http://www.makotemplates.org Mako]. Its installation is most
conveniently done by `pip`,

{{{
pip install Mako
}}}
This command requires `pip` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

{{{
sudo apt-get install python-pip
}}}
Alternatively, one can install from the `pip` [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip source code].

==== Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output ====

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need [http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex ptex2tex],
which is installed by

{{{
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
}}}
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, `cp2texmf.sh`:

{{{
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
}}}
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

{{{
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
}}}
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the `~/texmf/tex/latex/misc` directory).

Note that the `doconce ptex2tex` command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the `ptex2tex`
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by `ptex2tex` and `doconce ptext2tex`
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package [http://pygments.org Pygments]
to be installed:
{{{
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

If you use the minted style together with `ptex2tex`, you have to
enable it by the `-DMINTED` command-line argument to `ptex2tex`.  All
use of the minted style requires the `-shell-escape` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., `latex -shell-escape` or `pdflatex
-shell-escape`.

<wiki:comment> Say something about anslistings.sty </wiki:comment>

==== reStructuredText (reST) Output ====

The `rst` output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the [http://docutils.sourceforge.net docutils] package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

{{{
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
{{{
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
}}}

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
[http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf rst2pdf]. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the `rst2pdf` directory and
run the usual `sudo python setup.py install`.


Output to `sphinx` requires of course [http://sphinx.pocoo.org Sphinx],
installed by
{{{
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}

==== Markdown and Pandoc Output ====

The Doconce format `pandoc` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the `pandoc` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ Pandoc], written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

{{{
sudo apt-get install pandoc
}}}

==== Epydoc Output ====

When the output format is `epydoc` one needs that program too, installed
by
{{{
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
}}}

*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
`apt-get install` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For `svn` directories, go to the directory,
run `svn update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`. For
Mercurial (`hg`) directories, go to the directory, run
`hg pull; hg update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`.

#TITLE (actually governed by the filename): Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere

By '''Hans Petter Langtangen'''

==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

<ul>
 <li> When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage   eventually go with a particular format? <li> Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various   formats like [http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf LaTeX], [http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/ HTML], [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html reStructuredText], [http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html Sphinx], and [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax wiki]? Would it be convenient   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging? <li> Do you have the same information scattered around in different   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and   include it anywhere?</ul>

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.



== The Doconce Concept ==

Doconce is two things:


<ol>
 <li> Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,    emails). From reST you can (via <code>rst2*</code> programs) go to XML, HTML,    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via <code>unoconv</code>) to    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats. <li> Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".</ol>

Here are some Doconce features:


<ul>
  <li> Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than    LaTeX and HTML.  <li> Doconce can be converted to plain ''untagged'' text,    often desirable for computer programs and email.  <li> Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code    directly from the source code files via regular expressions    for the start and end lines.  <li> Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well    with big LaTeX projects (books).  <li> Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.  <li> Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming    construction for generating parts of the text.</ul>

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:


<ul>
  <li> Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.  <li> Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.  <li> Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.</ul>

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



== What Does Doconce Look Like? ==

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.


<ul>
  <li> Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.  <li> ''Emphasized words'' are surrounded by asterisks.  <li> '''Words in boldface''' are surrounded by underscores.  <li> Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and    then typeset <code>verbatim (in a monospace font)</code>.  <li> Section headings are recognied by equality (<code>=</code>) signs before    and after the title, and the number of <code>=</code> signs indicates the    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and    3 for subsubsection.  <li> Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore    before and after the heading.  <li> The abstract of a document starts with ''Abstract'' as paragraph    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,  <li> Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing    <code>!bc</code> (begin code) and <code>!ec</code> (end code) commands at separate lines    before and after the code block.  <li> Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.  <li> Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing    <code>!bt</code> (begin TeX) and <code>!et</code> (end TeX) commands at separate lines    before and after the math block.  <li> There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.  <li> Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.  <li> Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout    the text.  <li> Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such    comments).  <li> There is special support for advanced exercises features.  <li> With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined    in or out of the text.  <li> With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.</ul>

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
<code>
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
</code>
The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

==== A Subsection with Sample Text ====

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
'''boldface''' words, ''emphasized'' words, and <code>computer</code> words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,


<ul>
  <li> item 1  <li> item 2  <li> item 3</ul>

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an <code>o</code>
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:


<ol>
 <li> item 1 <li> item 2 <li> item 3</ol>

URLs with a link word are possible, as in [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl].
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in tutorial.do.txt.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section [#A_Subsection_with_Sample_Text].

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats] for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>    time    </b></td> <td align="center"><b>  velocity  </b></td> <td align="center"><b>acceleration</b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>

==== Mathematics and Computer Code ====

Inline mathematics, such as <math>\nu = \sin(x)</math>,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like <math>\nu = \sin(x)</math> is
typeset as
<code>
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
</code>
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
<code>!bt</code> and <code>!et</code> (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
:<math>
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
</math>
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes <code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>html</code>, and <code>sphinx</code>). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
<code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
</code>
A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to <code>sphinx</code>, <code>rst</code>, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., <code>!bc xxx</code>
where <code>xxx</code> is an identifier like <code>pycod</code> for code snippet in Python,
<code>sys</code> for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in <code>ptex2tex</code> and defined in a
configuration file <code>.ptext2tex.cfg</code>, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):
<code>
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</code>
By default, <code>pro</code> and <code>cod</code> are <code>python</code>, <code>sys</code> is <code>console</code>,
while <code>xpro</code> and <code>xcod</code> are computer language specific for <code>x</code>
in <code>f</code> (Fortran), <code>c</code> (C), <code>cpp</code> (C++), <code>pl</code> (Perl), <code>m</code> (Matlab),
<code>sh</code> (Unix shells), <code>cy</code> (Cython), and <code>py</code> (Python).

<!--> (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code -->
<!--> blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments -->
<!--> and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the -->
<!--> first one is used.) -->

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with <code>!bc pro</code>, while a part of a file is copied into a <code>!bc cod</code>
environment. What <code>pro</code> and <code>cod</code> mean is then defined through
a <code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code> file for LaTeX and a <code>sphinx code-blocks</code>
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing <code>#include "mynote.do.txt"</code>
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension <code>do.txt</code>. The <code>do</code> part stands for doconce, while the
trailing <code>.txt</code> denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.

==== Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography ====

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style ''newcommand''
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
<code>newcommand_replace.tex</code> are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names <code>newcommands.tex</code> and
<code>newcommands_keep.tex</code> are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
<code>!bt</code> and <code>!et</code> in <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code> to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
<code>newcommands_replace.tex</code> and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the <code>newcommands*.tex</code> files ''must'' appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the <code>doc/manual/manual.do.txt</code> file (see the
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html demo page]
for various formats of this document).


<!--> Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess): -->



== From Doconce to Other Formats ==

Transformation of a Doconce document <code>mydoc.do.txt</code> to various other
formats applies the script <code>doconce format</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
</code>
or just
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
</code>
The <code>mako</code> or <code>preprocess</code> programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to <code>mako</code> or <code>preprocess</code> can be added after the
filename. For example,
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
</code>
The variable <code>FORMAT</code> is always defined as the current format when
running <code>preprocess</code>. That is, in the last example, <code>FORMAT</code> is
defined as <code>latex</code>. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like <code>#if FORMAT == "latex"</code>.

The command-line arguments <code>--no-preprocess</code> and <code>--no-mako</code> turn off
running <code>preprocess</code> and <code>mako</code>, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
</code>
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
<code>
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
</code>
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

==== HTML ====

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file <code>mydoc.do.txt</code>
is performed by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
</code>
The resulting file <code>mydoc.html</code> can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the <code>pygmentize</code> program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument <code>--no-pygments-html</code>
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain <code><pre></code> HTML tags. The option <code>--pygments-html-linenos</code> turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": <code>%(title)s</code> for a title,
<code>%(date)s</code> for a date, and <code>%(main)s</code> for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
<code>DATE:</code> line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert <code>%(title)s</code> and
<code>%(date)s</code> at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by <code>%(main)s</code>. Here is an example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
</code>

==== Pandoc and Markdown ====

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
</code>
The name of the output file is <code>mydoc.mkd</code>.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
</code>
Pandoc supports <code>latex</code>, <code>html</code>, <code>odt</code> (OpenOffice), <code>docx</code> (Microsoft
Word), <code>rtf</code>, <code>texinfo</code>, to mention some. The <code>-R</code> option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the <code>--toc</code> option generates a table of contents.
See the [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html Pandoc documentation]
for the many features of the <code>pandoc</code> program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
<code>doconce format pandoc</code> and then translating using <code>pandoc</code>, or
<code>doconce format latex</code>, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using <code>pandoc</code>.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
</code>
When we go through <code>pandoc</code>, only single equations or <code>align*</code>
environments are well understood.

Quite some <code>doconce replace</code> and <code>doconce subst</code> edits might be needed
on the <code>.mkd</code> or <code>.tex</code> files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
</code>
The <code>-s</code> option adds a proper header and footer to the <code>mydoc.html</code> file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

==== LaTeX ====

Making a LaTeX file <code>mydoc.tex</code> from <code>mydoc.do.txt</code> is done in two steps:
<!--> Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many -->
<!--> formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph -->
<!--> environment, as used here. -->

''Step 1.'' Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form <code>mydoc.p.tex</code> for
the <code>ptex2tex</code> program (or <code>doconce ptex2tex</code>):
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
</code>
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files <code>newcommands.tex</code>, <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code>, or
<code>newcommands_replace.tex</code> (see the section [#Macros_(Newcommands),_Cross-References,_Index,_and_Bibliography]).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

''Step 2.'' Run <code>ptex2tex</code> (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
</code>
In case you do not have <code>ptex2tex</code>, you may run a (very) simplified version:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
</code>

Note that Doconce generates a <code>.p.tex</code> file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
</code>
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through <code>-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional</code>.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
<code>-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage</code>.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are


<ul>
 <li> <code>BOOK</code> for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings) <li> <code>PALATINO</code> for the Palatino font <li> <code>HELVETIA</code> for the Helvetica font <li> <code>A4PAPER</code> for A4 paper size <li> <code>A6PAPER</code> for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices) <li> <code>MOVIE15</code> for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies <li> <code>PREAMBLE</code> to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document   or document to be included elsewhere) <li> <code>MINTED</code> for inclusion of the minted package (which requires <code>latex</code>   or <code>pdflatex</code> to be run with the <code>-shell-escape</code> option)</ul>

The <code>ptex2tex</code> tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any <code>!bc</code> command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your <code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code>
file, e.g., <code>!bc sys</code> for a terminal session, where <code>sys</code> is set to
a certain environment in <code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code> (e.g., <code>CodeTerminal</code>).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the <code>doconce ptex2tex</code> command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the <code>.p.tex</code> file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
</code>
Note that <code>@</code> must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as <code>minted</code>
above, which implies <code>\begin{minted}{fortran}</code> and <code>\end{minted}</code> as
begin and end for blocks inside <code>!bc fpro</code> and <code>!ec</code>).  Specifying
<code>envir=ans:nt</code> means that all other environments are typeset with the
<code>anslistings.sty</code> package, e.g., <code>!bc cppcod</code> will then result in
<code>\begin{c++}</code>. If no environments like <code>sys</code>, <code>fpro</code>, or the common
<code>envir</code> are defined on the command line, the plain <code>\begin{verbatim}</code>
and <code>\end{verbatim}</code> used.


''Step 2b (optional).'' Edit the <code>mydoc.tex</code> file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute <code>section</code> by <code>section*</code> to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the <code>doconce replace</code> and <code>doconce subst</code>
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
</code>
A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

''Step 3.'' Compile <code>mydoc.tex</code>
and create the PDF file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
</code>

If one wishes to run <code>ptex2tex</code> and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (<code>Minted_Python</code>, <code>Minted_Cpp</code>, etc., in
<code>ptex2tex</code> specified through the <code>*pro</code> and <code>*cod</code> variables in
<code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code> or <code>$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg</code>), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running <code>ptex2tex</code> with the
<code>-DMINTED</code> option:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
</code>
In this case, <code>latex</code> must be run with the
<code>-shell-escape</code> option:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
</code>
When running <code>doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted</code> (or other minted
specifications with <code>doconce ptex2tex</code>), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the <code>-DMINTED</code> option.

==== PDFLaTeX ====

Running <code>pdflatex</code> instead of <code>latex</code> follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
</code>
Then <code>ptex2tex</code> is run as explained above, and finally
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
</code>

==== Plain ASCII Text ====

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
</code>

==== reStructuredText ====

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file <code>mydoc.rst</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
</code>
We may now produce various other formats:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
</code>

The OpenOffice file <code>mydoc.odt</code> can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program <code>unovonv</code>
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports ''on the command line''.
Run
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> unoconv --show
</code>
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
<code>mydoc.odt</code> to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
</code>

''Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.'' At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by <code>latex</code> as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the <code>sphinx</code> output format.

==== Sphinx ====

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the <code>doconce sphinx_dir</code> command:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
</code>
The keywords <code>author</code>, <code>title</code>, and <code>version</code> are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, <code>version</code> is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files <code>file1</code>,
<code>file2</code>, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files <code>file1</code>, <code>file2</code>, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of <code>dirname</code> is <code>sphinx-rootdir</code>. The <code>theme</code>
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is <code>'default'</code>).

With a single-file document in <code>mydoc.do.txt</code> one often just runs
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
</code>
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory <code>sphinx-rootdir</code> is made with
relevant files.

The <code>doconce sphinx_dir</code> command generates a script
<code>automake_sphinx.py</code> for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run <code>automake_sphinx.py</code> or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The <code>doconce sphinx_dir</code> script copies directories named <code>figs</code> or
<code>figures</code> over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, <code>automake_sphinx.py</code> must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not <code>http:</code> or <code>file:</code> URLs), must be
placed in the <code>_static</code> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility <code>doconce sphinxfix_localURLs</code> is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say <code>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</code> it
replaces the link by <code>_static/myfile.txt</code> and copies
<code>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</code> to a local <code>_static</code> directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in <code>_static</code> or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all <code>_static/*</code> files to the
<code>_static</code> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a <code>_static</code> or <code>_static-name</code> directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the <code>conf.py</code>
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
<code>make-themes.sh</code> can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes <code>fenics</code> and <code>pyramid</code>, one writes
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
</code>
The resulting directories with HTML documents are <code>_build/html_fenics</code>
and <code>_build/html_pyramid</code>, respectively. Without arguments,
<code>make-themes.sh</code> makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file <code>mydoc.do.txt</code>.

''Step 1.'' Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
</code>

''Step 2.'' Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive <code>sphinx-quickstart</code>
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
</code>
The autogenerated <code>conf.py</code> file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The <code>doconce sphinx_dir</code> generator makes an extended <code>conv.py</code>
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


''Step 3.'' Copy the <code>mydoc.rst</code> file to the Sphinx root directory:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
</code>
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with <code>mydoc.rst</code> in the <code>sphinx-rootdir</code>
directory. Either edit <code>mydoc.rst</code> so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to <code>sphinx-rootdir</code>.
Links to local files in <code>mydoc.rst</code> must be modified to links to
files in the <code>_static</code> directory, see comment above.

''Step 4.'' Edit the generated <code>index.rst</code> file so that <code>mydoc.rst</code>
is included, i.e., add <code>mydoc</code> to the <code>toctree</code> section so that it becomes
<code>
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
</code>
(The spaces before <code>mydoc</code> are important!)

''Step 5.'' Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
</code>

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with <code>index.html</code> files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

''Step 6.'' View the result:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
</code>

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows <code>!bc</code>: <code>cod</code> gives Python
(<code>code-block:: python</code> in Sphinx syntax) and <code>cppcod</code> gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

==== Wiki Formats ====

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
[http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax Googlecode wiki], MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
<code>gwiki</code>, <code>mwiki</code>, and <code>cwiki</code>, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
</code>

The Googlecode wiki document, <code>mydoc.gwiki</code>, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the <code>.gwiki</code> file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of [http://pediapress.com/code/ mwlib]. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write [http://en.wikibooks.org Wikibooks]
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.

==== Tweaking the Doconce Output ====

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
<code>.rst</code> file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if <code>.eps</code> or <code>.png</code> is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The <code>make.sh</code> files in <code>docs/manual</code> and <code>docs/tutorial</code>
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

==== Demos ====

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file
<code>
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
</code>
The file <code>make.sh</code> in the <code>tutorial</code> directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, <code>tutorial.do.txt</code> is the
starting point.  Running <code>make.sh</code> and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original <code>tutorial.do.txt</code> file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html Here]
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the <code>docs/manual</code> directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, <code>manual.do.txt</code>, to
various formats. The <code>make.sh</code> script runs a set of translations.



== Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies ==

==== Doconce ====

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at http://code.google.com/p/doconce.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (<code>hg</code>) source follows the standard procedure:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</code>
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
</code>

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo apt-get install doconce
</code>
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
</code>

==== Dependencies ====

==== Preprocessors ====

If you make use of the [http://code.google.com/p/preprocess Preprocess]
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</code>

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
[http://www.makotemplates.org Mako]. Its installation is most
conveniently done by <code>pip</code>,

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
pip install Mako
</code>
This command requires <code>pip</code> to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo apt-get install python-pip
</code>
Alternatively, one can install from the <code>pip</code> [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip source code].

==== Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output ====

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need [http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex ptex2tex],
which is installed by

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
</code>
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, <code>cp2texmf.sh</code>:

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
</code>
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that <code>ptex2tex</code> potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
</code>
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the <code>~/texmf/tex/latex/misc</code> directory).

Note that the <code>doconce ptex2tex</code> command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the <code>ptex2tex</code>
program.

The ''minted'' LaTeX style is offered by <code>ptex2tex</code> and <code>doconce ptext2tex</code>
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package [http://pygments.org Pygments]
to be installed:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
</code>

If you use the minted style together with <code>ptex2tex</code>, you have to
enable it by the <code>-DMINTED</code> command-line argument to <code>ptex2tex</code>.  All
use of the minted style requires the <code>-shell-escape</code> command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., <code>latex -shell-escape</code> or <code>pdflatex
-shell-escape</code>.

<!--> Say something about anslistings.sty -->

==== reStructuredText (reST) Output ====

The <code>rst</code> output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the [http://docutils.sourceforge.net docutils] package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</code>
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
</code>

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
[http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf rst2pdf]. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the <code>rst2pdf</code> directory and
run the usual <code>sudo python setup.py install</code>.


Output to <code>sphinx</code> requires of course [http://sphinx.pocoo.org Sphinx],
installed by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</code>

==== Markdown and Pandoc Output ====

The Doconce format <code>pandoc</code> outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the <code>pandoc</code> program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ Pandoc], written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo apt-get install pandoc
</code>

==== Epydoc Output ====

When the output format is <code>epydoc</code> one needs that program too, installed
by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
</code>

''Remark.'' Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
<code>apt-get install</code> command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For <code>svn</code> directories, go to the directory,
run <code>svn update</code>, and then <code>sudo python setup.py install</code>. For
Mercurial (<code>hg</code>) directories, go to the directory, run
<code>hg pull; hg update</code>, and then <code>sudo python setup.py install</code>.

#summary Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />
By **Hans Petter Langtangen**

=== Jan 32, 2100 ===

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage   eventually go with a particular format?
 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various   formats like [[http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf|LaTeX]], [[http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/|HTML]], [[http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html|reStructuredText]], [[http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html|Sphinx]], and [[http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax|wiki]]? Would it be convenient   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?
 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.



= The Doconce Concept =

Doconce is two things:


 # Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,    emails). From reST you can (via {{{rst2*}}} programs) go to XML, HTML,    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via {{{unoconv}}}) to    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.
 # Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:


  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than    LaTeX and HTML.
  * Doconce can be converted to plain //untagged// text,    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code    directly from the source code files via regular expressions    for the start and end lines.
  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:


  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



= What Does Doconce Look Like? =

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.


  * Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.
  * //Emphasized words// are surrounded by asterisks.
  * **Words in boldface** are surrounded by underscores.
  * Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and    then typeset {{{verbatim (in a monospace font)}}}.
  * Section headings are recognied by equality ({{{=}}}) signs before    and after the title, and the number of {{{=}}} signs indicates the    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and    3 for subsubsection.
  * Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore    before and after the heading.
  * The abstract of a document starts with //Abstract// as paragraph    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,
  * Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing    {{{!bc}}} (begin code) and {{{!ec}}} (end code) commands at separate lines    before and after the code block.
  * Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.
  * Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing    {{{!bt}}} (begin TeX) and {{{!et}}} (end TeX) commands at separate lines    before and after the math block.
  * There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.
  * Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.
  * Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout    the text.
  * Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such    comments).
  * There is special support for advanced exercises features.
  * With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined    in or out of the text.
  * With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
{{{
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
}}}
The Doconce text above results in the following little document:


== A Subsection with Sample Text ==

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
**boldface** words, //emphasized// words, and {{{computer}}} words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,


  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an {{{o}}}
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:


 # item 1
 # item 2
 # item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in [[http://folk.uio.no/hpl|hpl]].
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in [[tutorial.do.txt]].

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section [#A_Subsection_with_Sample_Text].

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats] for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,


 | =time             | =velocity         | =acceleration     |
 |  0.0              |  1.4186           |  -5.01            |
 |  2.0              |  1.376512         |  11.919           |
 |  4.0              |  1.1E+1           |  14.717624        |


== Mathematics and Computer Code ==

Inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x),
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as
{{{
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
}}}
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
{{{!bt}}} and {{{!et}}} (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
{{{
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
}}}
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes {{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}}, {{{html}}}, and {{{sphinx}}}). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
{{{!bc}}} and {{{!ec}}} instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like
{{{
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
}}}
A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to {{{sphinx}}}, {{{rst}}}, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., {{{!bc xxx}}}
where {{{xxx}}} is an identifier like {{{pycod}}} for code snippet in Python,
{{{sys}}} for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in {{{ptex2tex}}} and defined in a
configuration file {{{.ptext2tex.cfg}}}, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
By default, {{{pro}}} and {{{cod}}} are {{{python}}}, {{{sys}}} is {{{console}}},
while {{{xpro}}} and {{{xcod}}} are computer language specific for {{{x}}}
in {{{f}}} (Fortran), {{{c}}} (C), {{{cpp}}} (C++), {{{pl}}} (Perl), {{{m}}} (Matlab),
{{{sh}}} (Unix shells), {{{cy}}} (Cython), and {{{py}}} (Python).

<wiki:comment> blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> first one is used.) </wiki:comment>

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with {{{!bc pro}}}, while a part of a file is copied into a {{{!bc cod}}}
environment. What {{{pro}}} and {{{cod}}} mean is then defined through
a {{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}} file for LaTeX and a {{{sphinx code-blocks}}}
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing {{{#include "mynote.do.txt"}}}
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension {{{do.txt}}}. The {{{do}}} part stands for doconce, while the
trailing {{{.txt}}} denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


== Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography ==

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style //newcommand//
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
{{{newcommand_replace.tex}}} are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names {{{newcommands.tex}}} and
{{{newcommands_keep.tex}}} are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
{{{!bt}}} and {{{!et}}} in {{{newcommands_keep.tex}}} to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
{{{newcommands_replace.tex}}} and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the {{{newcommands*.tex}}} files //must// appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the {{{doc/manual/manual.do.txt}}} file (see the
[[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html|demo page]]
for various formats of this document).


<wiki:comment> Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess): </wiki:comment>



= From Doconce to Other Formats =

Transformation of a Doconce document {{{mydoc.do.txt}}} to various other
formats applies the script {{{doconce format}}}:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
}}}
or just
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
}}}
The {{{mako}}} or {{{preprocess}}} programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to {{{mako}}} or {{{preprocess}}} can be added after the
filename. For example,
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
}}}
The variable {{{FORMAT}}} is always defined as the current format when
running {{{preprocess}}}. That is, in the last example, {{{FORMAT}}} is
defined as {{{latex}}}. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like {{{#if FORMAT == "latex"}}}.

The command-line arguments {{{--no-preprocess}}} and {{{--no-mako}}} turn off
running {{{preprocess}}} and {{{mako}}}, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
}}}
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
{{{
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
}}}
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


== HTML ==

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file {{{mydoc.do.txt}}}
is performed by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
}}}
The resulting file {{{mydoc.html}}} can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the {{{pygmentize}}} program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument {{{--no-pygments-html}}}
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain {{{<pre>}}} HTML tags. The option {{{--pygments-html-linenos}}} turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": {{{%(title)s}}} for a title,
{{{%(date)s}}} for a date, and {{{%(main)s}}} for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
{{{DATE:}}} line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert {{{%(title)s}}} and
{{{%(date)s}}} at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by {{{%(main)s}}}. Here is an example:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
}}}


== Pandoc and Markdown ==

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
{{{
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
}}}
The name of the output file is {{{mydoc.mkd}}}.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
{{{
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
}}}
Pandoc supports {{{latex}}}, {{{html}}}, {{{odt}}} (OpenOffice), {{{docx}}} (Microsoft
Word), {{{rtf}}}, {{{texinfo}}}, to mention some. The {{{-R}}} option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the {{{--toc}}} option generates a table of contents.
See the [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html|Pandoc documentation]]
for the many features of the {{{pandoc}}} program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
{{{doconce format pandoc}}} and then translating using {{{pandoc}}}, or
{{{doconce format latex}}}, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using {{{pandoc}}}.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
}}}
When we go through {{{pandoc}}}, only single equations or {{{align*}}}
environments are well understood.

Quite some {{{doconce replace}}} and {{{doconce subst}}} edits might be needed
on the {{{.mkd}}} or {{{.tex}}} files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
}}}
The {{{-s}}} option adds a proper header and footer to the {{{mydoc.html}}} file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


== LaTeX ==

Making a LaTeX file {{{mydoc.tex}}} from {{{mydoc.do.txt}}} is done in two steps:
<wiki:comment> Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> environment, as used here. </wiki:comment>

//Step 1.// Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form {{{mydoc.p.tex}}} for
the {{{ptex2tex}}} program (or {{{doconce ptex2tex}}}):
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
}}}
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files {{{newcommands.tex}}}, {{{newcommands_keep.tex}}}, or
{{{newcommands_replace.tex}}} (see the section [#Macros_(Newcommands),_Cross-References,_Index,_and_Bibliography]).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

//Step 2.// Run {{{ptex2tex}}} (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
}}}
In case you do not have {{{ptex2tex}}}, you may run a (very) simplified version:
{{{
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
}}}

Note that Doconce generates a {{{.p.tex}}} file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
}}}
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through {{{-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional}}}.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
{{{-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage}}}.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are


 * {{{BOOK}}} for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 * {{{PALATINO}}} for the Palatino font
 * {{{HELVETIA}}} for the Helvetica font
 * {{{A4PAPER}}} for A4 paper size
 * {{{A6PAPER}}} for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 * {{{MOVIE15}}} for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 * {{{PREAMBLE}}} to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document   or document to be included elsewhere)
 * {{{MINTED}}} for inclusion of the minted package (which requires {{{latex}}}   or {{{pdflatex}}} to be run with the {{{-shell-escape}}} option)

The {{{ptex2tex}}} tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any {{{!bc}}} command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your {{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}}
file, e.g., {{{!bc sys}}} for a terminal session, where {{{sys}}} is set to
a certain environment in {{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}} (e.g., {{{CodeTerminal}}}).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the {{{doconce ptex2tex}}} command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the {{{.p.tex}}} file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
{{{
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
}}}
Note that {{{@}}} must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as {{{minted}}}
above, which implies {{{\begin{minted}{fortran}}}} and {{{\end{minted}}}} as
begin and end for blocks inside {{{!bc fpro}}} and {{{!ec}}}).  Specifying
{{{envir=ans:nt}}} means that all other environments are typeset with the
{{{anslistings.sty}}} package, e.g., {{{!bc cppcod}}} will then result in
{{{\begin{c++}}}}. If no environments like {{{sys}}}, {{{fpro}}}, or the common
{{{envir}}} are defined on the command line, the plain {{{\begin{verbatim}}}}
and {{{\end{verbatim}}}} used.


//Step 2b (optional).// Edit the {{{mydoc.tex}}} file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute {{{section}}} by {{{section*}}} to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the {{{doconce replace}}} and {{{doconce subst}}}
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
{{{
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
}}}
A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

//Step 3.// Compile {{{mydoc.tex}}}
and create the PDF file:
{{{
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}

If one wishes to run {{{ptex2tex}}} and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks ({{{Minted_Python}}}, {{{Minted_Cpp}}}, etc., in
{{{ptex2tex}}} specified through the {{{*pro}}} and {{{*cod}}} variables in
{{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}} or {{{$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg}}}), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running {{{ptex2tex}}} with the
{{{-DMINTED}}} option:
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
}}}
In this case, {{{latex}}} must be run with the
{{{-shell-escape}}} option:
{{{
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}
When running {{{doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted}}} (or other minted
specifications with {{{doconce ptex2tex}}}), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the {{{-DMINTED}}} option.


== PDFLaTeX ==

Running {{{pdflatex}}} instead of {{{latex}}} follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
}}}
Then {{{ptex2tex}}} is run as explained above, and finally
{{{
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
}}}


== Plain ASCII Text ==

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
}}}


== reStructuredText ==

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file {{{mydoc.rst}}}:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
}}}
We may now produce various other formats:
{{{
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
}}}

The OpenOffice file {{{mydoc.odt}}} can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program {{{unovonv}}}
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports //on the command line//.
Run
{{{
Terminal> unoconv --show
}}}
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
{{{mydoc.odt}}} to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
{{{
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
}}}

//Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.// At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by {{{latex}}} as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the {{{sphinx}}} output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.


 * [[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1033441]]
 * [[http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/textopc.html]]
 * [[http://nileshbansal.blogspot.com/2007/12/latex-to-openofficeword.html]]


== Sphinx ==

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the {{{doconce sphinx_dir}}} command:
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
}}}
The keywords {{{author}}}, {{{title}}}, and {{{version}}} are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, {{{version}}} is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files {{{file1}}},
{{{file2}}}, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files {{{file1}}}, {{{file2}}}, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of {{{dirname}}} is {{{sphinx-rootdir}}}. The {{{theme}}}
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is {{{'default'}}}).

With a single-file document in {{{mydoc.do.txt}}} one often just runs
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
}}}
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory {{{sphinx-rootdir}}} is made with
relevant files.

The {{{doconce sphinx_dir}}} command generates a script
{{{automake_sphinx.py}}} for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run {{{automake_sphinx.py}}} or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The {{{doconce sphinx_dir}}} script copies directories named {{{figs}}} or
{{{figures}}} over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, {{{automake_sphinx.py}}} must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not {{{http:}}} or {{{file:}}} URLs), must be
placed in the {{{_static}}} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility {{{doconce sphinxfix_localURLs}}} is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say {{{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt}}} it
replaces the link by {{{_static/myfile.txt}}} and copies
{{{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt}}} to a local {{{_static}}} directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in {{{_static}}} or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all {{{_static/*}}} files to the
{{{_static}}} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a {{{_static}}} or {{{_static-name}}} directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the {{{conf.py}}}
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
{{{make-themes.sh}}} can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes {{{fenics}}} and {{{pyramid}}}, one writes
{{{
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
}}}
The resulting directories with HTML documents are {{{_build/html_fenics}}}
and {{{_build/html_pyramid}}}, respectively. Without arguments,
{{{make-themes.sh}}} makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file {{{mydoc.do.txt}}}.

//Step 1.// Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
}}}

//Step 2.// Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive {{{sphinx-quickstart}}}
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
{{{
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
}}}
The autogenerated {{{conf.py}}} file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The {{{doconce sphinx_dir}}} generator makes an extended {{{conv.py}}}
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


//Step 3.// Copy the {{{mydoc.rst}}} file to the Sphinx root directory:
{{{
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
}}}
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with {{{mydoc.rst}}} in the {{{sphinx-rootdir}}}
directory. Either edit {{{mydoc.rst}}} so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to {{{sphinx-rootdir}}}.
Links to local files in {{{mydoc.rst}}} must be modified to links to
files in the {{{_static}}} directory, see comment above.

//Step 4.// Edit the generated {{{index.rst}}} file so that {{{mydoc.rst}}}
is included, i.e., add {{{mydoc}}} to the {{{toctree}}} section so that it becomes
{{{
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
}}}
(The spaces before {{{mydoc}}} are important!)

//Step 5.// Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
{{{
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
}}}

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with {{{index.html}}} files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

//Step 6.// View the result:
{{{
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
}}}

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows {{{!bc}}}: {{{cod}}} gives Python
({{{code-block:: python}}} in Sphinx syntax) and {{{cppcod}}} gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


== Wiki Formats ==

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
[[http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax|Googlecode wiki]], MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
{{{gwiki}}}, {{{mwiki}}}, and {{{cwiki}}}, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
}}}

The Googlecode wiki document, {{{mydoc.gwiki}}}, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the {{{.gwiki}}} file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of [[http://pediapress.com/code/|mwlib]]. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write [[http://en.wikibooks.org|Wikibooks]]
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


== Tweaking the Doconce Output ==

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
{{{.rst}}} file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if {{{.eps}}} or {{{.png}}} is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The {{{make.sh}}} files in {{{docs/manual}}} and {{{docs/tutorial}}}
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


== Demos ==

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file
{{{
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
}}}
The file {{{make.sh}}} in the {{{tutorial}}} directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, {{{tutorial.do.txt}}} is the
starting point.  Running {{{make.sh}}} and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original {{{tutorial.do.txt}}} file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
[[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html|Here]]
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the {{{docs/manual}}} directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, {{{manual.do.txt}}}, to
various formats. The {{{make.sh}}} script runs a set of translations.



= Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies =


== Doconce ==

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at [[http://code.google.com/p/doconce]].  Its installation from the
Mercurial ({{{hg}}}) source follows the standard procedure:
{{{
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
{{{
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
{{{
sudo apt-get install doconce
}}}
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
{{{
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
}}}


== Dependencies ==

=== Preprocessors ===

If you make use of the [[http://code.google.com/p/preprocess|Preprocess]]
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

{{{
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
[[http://www.makotemplates.org|Mako]]. Its installation is most
conveniently done by {{{pip}}},

{{{
pip install Mako
}}}
This command requires {{{pip}}} to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

{{{
sudo apt-get install python-pip
}}}
Alternatively, one can install from the {{{pip}}} [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip|source code]].

=== Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output ===

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need [[http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex|ptex2tex]],
which is installed by

{{{
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
}}}
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, {{{cp2texmf.sh}}}:

{{{
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
}}}
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that {{{ptex2tex}}} potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

{{{
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
}}}
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the {{{~/texmf/tex/latex/misc}}} directory).

Note that the {{{doconce ptex2tex}}} command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the {{{ptex2tex}}}
program.

The //minted// LaTeX style is offered by {{{ptex2tex}}} and {{{doconce ptext2tex}}}
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package [[http://pygments.org|Pygments]]
to be installed:
{{{
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

If you use the minted style together with {{{ptex2tex}}}, you have to
enable it by the {{{-DMINTED}}} command-line argument to {{{ptex2tex}}}.  All
use of the minted style requires the {{{-shell-escape}}} command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., {{{latex -shell-escape}}} or {{{pdflatex
-shell-escape}}}.

=== reStructuredText (reST) Output ===

The {{{rst}}} output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the [[http://docutils.sourceforge.net|docutils]] package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

{{{
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
{{{
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
}}}

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
[[http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf|rst2pdf]]. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the {{{rst2pdf}}} directory and
run the usual {{{sudo python setup.py install}}}.


Output to {{{sphinx}}} requires of course [[http://sphinx.pocoo.org|Sphinx]],
installed by
{{{
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}

=== Markdown and Pandoc Output ===

The Doconce format {{{pandoc}}} outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the {{{pandoc}}} program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/|Pandoc]], written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

{{{
sudo apt-get install pandoc
}}}

=== Epydoc Output ===

When the output format is {{{epydoc}}} one needs that program too, installed
by
{{{
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
}}}

//Remark.// Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
{{{apt-get install}}} command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For {{{svn}}} directories, go to the directory,
run {{{svn update}}}, and then {{{sudo python setup.py install}}}. For
Mercurial ({{{hg}}}) directories, go to the directory, run
{{{hg pull; hg update}}}, and then {{{sudo python setup.py install}}}.

TITLE: Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Simula Research Laboratory, and University of Oslo)DATE: today


 - When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?
 - Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like "http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf":LaTeX, "http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/":HTML, "http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html":reStructuredText, "http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html":Sphinx, and "http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax":wiki? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?
 - Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.

The Doconce Concept

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via 'rst2*' programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via 'unoconv') to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.
 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  - Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  - Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  - Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.
  - Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  - Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  - Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  - Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  - Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  - Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.

What Does Doconce Look Like?

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.

  - Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.
  - *Emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks.
  - **Words in boldface** are surrounded by underscores.
  - Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset 'verbatim (in a monospace font)'.
  - Section headings are recognied by equality ('=') signs before
    and after the title, and the number of '=' signs indicates the
    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and
    3 for subsubsection.
  - Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading.
  - The abstract of a document starts with *Abstract* as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,
  - Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    '!bc' (begin code) and '!ec' (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block.
  - Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.
  - Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    '!bt' (begin TeX) and '!et' (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block.
  - There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.
  - Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.
  - Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout
    the text.
  - Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can
    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such
    comments).
  - There is special support for advanced exercises features.
  - With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text.
  - With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format::


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

A Subsection with Sample Text

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
**boldface** words, *emphasized* words, and 'computer' words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an 'o'
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1
 2. item 2
 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "tutorial.do.txt":tutorial.do.txt.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section "A Subsection with Sample Text".

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

Mathematics and Computer Code

Inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x),
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as::


        $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
'!bt' and '!et' (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this::

        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes 'latex', 'pdflatex', 'html', and 'sphinx'). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
'!bc' and '!ec' instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like::


        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to 'sphinx', 'rst', and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., '!bc xxx'
where 'xxx' is an identifier like 'pycod' for code snippet in Python,
'sys' for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in 'ptex2tex' and defined in a
configuration file '.ptext2tex.cfg', while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments)::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, 'pro' and 'cod' are 'python', 'sys' is 'console',
while 'xpro' and 'xcod' are computer language specific for 'x'
in 'f' (Fortran), 'c' (C), 'cpp' (C++), 'pl' (Perl), 'm' (Matlab),
'sh' (Unix shells), 'cy' (Cython), and 'py' (Python).


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with '!bc pro', while a part of a file is copied into a '!bc cod'
environment. What 'pro' and 'cod' mean is then defined through
a '.ptex2tex.cfg' file for LaTeX and a 'sphinx code-blocks'
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing '#include "mynote.do.txt"'
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension 'do.txt'. The 'do' part stands for doconce, while the
trailing '.txt' denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.

Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
'newcommand_replace.tex' are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names 'newcommands.tex' and
'newcommands_keep.tex' are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
'!bt' and '!et' in 'newcommands_keep.tex' to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
'newcommands_replace.tex' and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the 'newcommands*.tex' files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the 'doc/manual/manual.do.txt' file (see the
"https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html":demo page
for various formats of this document).

From Doconce to Other Formats

Transformation of a Doconce document 'mydoc.do.txt' to various other
formats applies the script 'doconce format':
!bc sys
        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The 'mako' or 'preprocess' programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to 'mako' or 'preprocess' can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable 'FORMAT' is always defined as the current format when
running 'preprocess'. That is, in the last example, 'FORMAT' is
defined as 'latex'. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like '#if FORMAT == "latex"'.

The command-line arguments '--no-preprocess' and '--no-mako' turn off
running 'preprocess' and 'mako', respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

HTML

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file 'mydoc.do.txt'
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file 'mydoc.html' can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the 'pygmentize' program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument '--no-pygments-html'
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain '<pre>' HTML tags. The option '--pygments-html-linenos' turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": '%(title)s' for a title,
'%(date)s' for a date, and '%(main)s' for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
'DATE:' line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert '%(title)s' and
'%(date)s' at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by '%(main)s'. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html


Pandoc and Markdown

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is 'mydoc.mkd'.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats::


        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd

Pandoc supports 'latex', 'html', 'odt' (OpenOffice), 'docx' (Microsoft
Word), 'rtf', 'texinfo', to mention some. The '-R' option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the '--toc' option generates a table of contents.
See the "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html":Pandoc documentation
for the many features of the 'pandoc' program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
'doconce format pandoc' and then translating using 'pandoc', or
'doconce format latex', and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using 'pandoc'.
Here is an example on the latter strategy::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through 'pandoc', only single equations or 'align*'
environments are well understood.

Quite some 'doconce replace' and 'doconce subst' edits might be needed
on the '.mkd' or '.tex' files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd

The '-s' option adds a proper header and footer to the 'mydoc.html' file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

LaTeX

Making a LaTeX file 'mydoc.tex' from 'mydoc.do.txt' is done in two steps:

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form 'mydoc.p.tex' for
the 'ptex2tex' program (or 'doconce ptex2tex')::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files 'newcommands.tex', 'newcommands_keep.tex', or
'newcommands_replace.tex' (see the section "Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run 'ptex2tex' (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have 'ptex2tex', you may run a (very) simplified version::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc


Note that Doconce generates a '.p.tex' file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through '-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional'.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
'-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage'.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 - 'BOOK' for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 - 'PALATINO' for the Palatino font
 - 'HELVETIA' for the Helvetica font
 - 'A4PAPER' for A4 paper size
 - 'A6PAPER' for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 - 'MOVIE15' for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 - 'PREAMBLE' to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)
 - 'MINTED' for inclusion of the minted package (which requires 'latex'
   or 'pdflatex' to be run with the '-shell-escape' option)

The 'ptex2tex' tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any '!bc' command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your '.ptex2tex.cfg'
file, e.g., '!bc sys' for a terminal session, where 'sys' is set to
a certain environment in '.ptex2tex.cfg' (e.g., 'CodeTerminal').
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the 'doconce ptex2tex' command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the '.p.tex' file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
                  -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that '@' must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as 'minted'
above, which implies '\begin{minted}{fortran}' and '\end{minted}' as
begin and end for blocks inside '!bc fpro' and '!ec').  Specifying
'envir=ans:nt' means that all other environments are typeset with the
'anslistings.sty' package, e.g., '!bc cppcod' will then result in
'\begin{c++}'. If no environments like 'sys', 'fpro', or the common
'envir' are defined on the command line, the plain '\begin{verbatim}'
and '\end{verbatim}' used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the 'mydoc.tex' file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute 'section' by 'section*' to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the 'doconce replace' and 'doconce subst'
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples::


        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile 'mydoc.tex'
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc


If one wishes to run 'ptex2tex' and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks ('Minted_Python', 'Minted_Cpp', etc., in
'ptex2tex' specified through the '*pro' and '*cod' variables in
'.ptex2tex.cfg' or '$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg'), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running 'ptex2tex' with the
'-DMINTED' option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, 'latex' must be run with the
'-shell-escape' option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

When running 'doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted' (or other minted
specifications with 'doconce ptex2tex'), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the '-DMINTED' option.

PDFLaTeX

Running 'pdflatex' instead of 'latex' follows almost the same steps,
but the start is::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then 'ptex2tex' is run as explained above, and finally::


        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc


Plain ASCII Text

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file 'mydoc.rst':
!bc sys
        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice


The OpenOffice file 'mydoc.odt' can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program 'unovonv'
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run::


        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
'mydoc.odt' to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF::


        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt


*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by 'latex' as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the 'sphinx' output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the 'doconce sphinx_dir' command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords 'author', 'title', and 'version' are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, 'version' is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files 'file1',
'file2', etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files 'file1', 'file2', etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of 'dirname' is 'sphinx-rootdir'. The 'theme'
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ''default'').

With a single-file document in 'mydoc.do.txt' one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory 'sphinx-rootdir' is made with
relevant files.

The 'doconce sphinx_dir' command generates a script
'automake_sphinx.py' for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run 'automake_sphinx.py' or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The 'doconce sphinx_dir' script copies directories named 'figs' or
'figures' over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, 'automake_sphinx.py' must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not 'http:' or 'file:' URLs), must be
placed in the '_static' subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility 'doconce sphinxfix_localURLs' is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say 'dir1/dir2/myfile.txt' it
replaces the link by '_static/myfile.txt' and copies
'dir1/dir2/myfile.txt' to a local '_static' directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in '_static' or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all '_static/*' files to the
'_static' subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a '_static' or '_static-name' directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the 'conf.py'
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
'make-themes.sh' can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes 'fenics' and 'pyramid', one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are '_build/html_fenics'
and '_build/html_pyramid', respectively. Without arguments,
'make-themes.sh' makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file 'mydoc.do.txt'.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive 'sphinx-quickstart'
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated 'conf.py' file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The 'doconce sphinx_dir' generator makes an extended 'conv.py'
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the 'mydoc.rst' file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with 'mydoc.rst' in the 'sphinx-rootdir'
directory. Either edit 'mydoc.rst' so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to 'sphinx-rootdir'.
Links to local files in 'mydoc.rst' must be modified to links to
files in the '_static' directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated 'index.rst' file so that 'mydoc.rst'
is included, i.e., add 'mydoc' to the 'toctree' section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before 'mydoc' are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with 'index.html' files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows '!bc': 'cod' gives Python
('code-block:: python' in Sphinx syntax) and 'cppcod' gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

Wiki Formats

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
"http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax":Googlecode wiki, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
'gwiki', 'mwiki', and 'cwiki', respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt


The Googlecode wiki document, 'mydoc.gwiki', is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the '.gwiki' file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of "http://pediapress.com/code/":mwlib. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write "http://en.wikibooks.org":Wikibooks
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.

Tweaking the Doconce Output

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
'.rst' file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if '.eps' or '.png' is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The 'make.sh' files in 'docs/manual' and 'docs/tutorial'
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

Demos

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file 'make.sh' in the 'tutorial' directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, 'tutorial.do.txt' is the
starting point.  Running 'make.sh' and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original 'tutorial.do.txt' file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
"https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html":Here
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the 'docs/manual' directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, 'manual.do.txt', to
various formats. The 'make.sh' script runs a set of translations.

Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies

Doconce

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at "http://code.google.com/p/doconce":http://code.google.com/p/doconce.  Its installation from the
Mercurial ('hg') source follows the standard procedure::


        # Doconce
        hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version::


        cd doconce
        hg pull
        hg update
        sudo python setup.py install


Debian GNU/Linux users can also run::


        sudo apt-get install doconce

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run::


        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install doconce


Dependencies

Preprocessors

If you make use of the "http://code.google.com/p/preprocess":Preprocess
preprocessor, this program must be installed::


        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
"http://www.makotemplates.org":Mako. Its installation is most
conveniently done by 'pip',

!bc sys
        pip install Mako

This command requires 'pip' to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by::


        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the 'pip' "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip":source code.

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex":ptex2tex,
which is installed by::


        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, 'cp2texmf.sh':

!bc sys
        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that 'ptex2tex' potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by::


        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the '~/texmf/tex/latex/misc' directory).

Note that the 'doconce ptex2tex' command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the 'ptex2tex'
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by 'ptex2tex' and 'doconce ptext2tex'
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package "http://pygments.org":Pygments
to be installed::


        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install


If you use the minted style together with 'ptex2tex', you have to
enable it by the '-DMINTED' command-line argument to 'ptex2tex'.  All
use of the minted style requires the '-shell-escape' command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., 'latex -shell-escape' or 'pdflatex
-shell-escape'.

reStructuredText (reST) Output

The 'rst' output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the "http://docutils.sourceforge.net":docutils package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by::


        svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install::


        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths


There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
"http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf":rst2pdf. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the 'rst2pdf' directory and
run the usual 'sudo python setup.py install'.


Output to 'sphinx' requires of course "http://sphinx.pocoo.org":Sphinx,
installed by::


        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


Markdown and Pandoc Output

The Doconce format 'pandoc' outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the 'pandoc' program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/":Pandoc, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by::


        sudo apt-get install pandoc


Epydoc Output

When the output format is 'epydoc' one needs that program too, installed
by::


        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..


*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
'apt-get install' command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For 'svn' directories, go to the directory,
run 'svn update', and then 'sudo python setup.py install'. For
Mercurial ('hg') directories, go to the directory, run
'hg pull; hg update', and then 'sudo python setup.py install'.

TITLE: Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Simula Research Laboratory, and University of Oslo)DATE: today


 - When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?
 - Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like U{LaTeX<http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf>}, U{HTML<http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/>}, U{reStructuredText<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>}, U{Sphinx<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>}, and U{wiki<http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>}? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?
 - Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


The Doconce Concept
===================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via C{rst2*} programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via C{unoconv}) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.
 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  - Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  - Doconce can be converted to plain I{untagged} text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  - Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.
  - Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  - Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  - Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  - Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  - Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  - Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



What Does Doconce Look Like?
============================

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.

  - Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.
  - I{Emphasized words} are surrounded by asterisks.
  - B{Words in boldface} are surrounded by underscores.
  - Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset C{verbatim (in a monospace font)}.
  - Section headings are recognied by equality (C{=}) signs before
    and after the title, and the number of C{=} signs indicates the
    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and
    3 for subsubsection.
  - Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading.
  - The abstract of a document starts with I{Abstract} as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,
  - Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    C{!bc} (begin code) and C{!ec} (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block.
  - Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.
  - Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    C{!bt} (begin TeX) and C{!et} (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block.
  - There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.
  - Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.
  - Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout
    the text.
  - Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can
    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such
    comments).
  - There is special support for advanced exercises features.
  - With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text.
  - With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format::


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
B{boldface} words, I{emphasized} words, and C{computer} words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an C{o}
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1
 2. item 2
 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in U{tutorial.do.txt<tutorial.do.txt>}.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section "A Subsection with Sample Text".

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as M{v = sin(x)},
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like M{v = sin(x)} is
typeset as::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
C{!bt} and C{!et} (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes C{latex}, C{pdflatex}, C{html}, and C{sphinx}). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
C{!bc} and C{!ec} instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like::


        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to C{sphinx}, C{rst}, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., C{!bc xxx}
where C{xxx} is an identifier like C{pycod} for code snippet in Python,
C{sys} for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in C{ptex2tex} and defined in a
configuration file C{.ptext2tex.cfg}, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments)::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, C{pro} and C{cod} are C{python}, C{sys} is C{console},
while C{xpro} and C{xcod} are computer language specific for C{x}
in C{f} (Fortran), C{c} (C), C{cpp} (C++), C{pl} (Perl), C{m} (Matlab),
C{sh} (Unix shells), C{cy} (Cython), and C{py} (Python).


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with C{!bc pro}, while a part of a file is copied into a C{!bc cod}
environment. What C{pro} and C{cod} mean is then defined through
a C{.ptex2tex.cfg} file for LaTeX and a C{sphinx code-blocks}
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing C{#include "mynote.do.txt"}
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension C{do.txt}. The C{do} part stands for doconce, while the
trailing C{.txt} denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style I{newcommand}
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
C{newcommand_replace.tex} are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names C{newcommands.tex} and
C{newcommands_keep.tex} are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
C{!bt} and C{!et} in C{newcommands_keep.tex} to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
C{newcommands_replace.tex} and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the C{newcommands*.tex} files I{must} appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the C{doc/manual/manual.do.txt} file (see the
U{demo page<https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>}
for various formats of this document).




From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document C{mydoc.do.txt} to various other
formats applies the script C{doconce format}::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The C{mako} or C{preprocess} programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to C{mako} or C{preprocess} can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable C{FORMAT} is always defined as the current format when
running C{preprocess}. That is, in the last example, C{FORMAT} is
defined as C{latex}. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like C{#if FORMAT == "latex"}.

The command-line arguments C{--no-preprocess} and C{--no-mako} turn off
running C{preprocess} and C{mako}, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file C{mydoc.do.txt}
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file C{mydoc.html} can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the C{pygmentize} program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument C{--no-pygments-html}
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain C{<pre>} HTML tags. The option C{--pygments-html-linenos} turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": C{%(title)s} for a title,
C{%(date)s} for a date, and C{%(main)s} for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
C{DATE:} line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert C{%(title)s} and
C{%(date)s} at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by C{%(main)s}. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html


Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is C{mydoc.mkd}.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats::


        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd

Pandoc supports C{latex}, C{html}, C{odt} (OpenOffice), C{docx} (Microsoft
Word), C{rtf}, C{texinfo}, to mention some. The C{-R} option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the C{--toc} option generates a table of contents.
See the U{Pandoc documentation<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html>}
for the many features of the C{pandoc} program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
C{doconce format pandoc} and then translating using C{pandoc}, or
C{doconce format latex}, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using C{pandoc}.
Here is an example on the latter strategy::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through C{pandoc}, only single equations or C{align*}
environments are well understood.

Quite some C{doconce replace} and C{doconce subst} edits might be needed
on the C{.mkd} or C{.tex} files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd

The C{-s} option adds a proper header and footer to the C{mydoc.html} file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file C{mydoc.tex} from C{mydoc.do.txt} is done in two steps:

I{Step 1.} Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form C{mydoc.p.tex} for
the C{ptex2tex} program (or C{doconce ptex2tex})::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files C{newcommands.tex}, C{newcommands_keep.tex}, or
C{newcommands_replace.tex} (see the section "Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

I{Step 2.} Run C{ptex2tex} (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have C{ptex2tex}, you may run a (very) simplified version::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc


Note that Doconce generates a C{.p.tex} file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through C{-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional}.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
C{-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage}.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 - C{BOOK} for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 - C{PALATINO} for the Palatino font
 - C{HELVETIA} for the Helvetica font
 - C{A4PAPER} for A4 paper size
 - C{A6PAPER} for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 - C{MOVIE15} for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 - C{PREAMBLE} to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)
 - C{MINTED} for inclusion of the minted package (which requires C{latex}
   or C{pdflatex} to be run with the C{-shell-escape} option)

The C{ptex2tex} tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any C{!bc} command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your C{.ptex2tex.cfg}
file, e.g., C{!bc sys} for a terminal session, where C{sys} is set to
a certain environment in C{.ptex2tex.cfg} (e.g., C{CodeTerminal}).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the C{doconce ptex2tex} command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the C{.p.tex} file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
                  -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that C{@} must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as C{minted}
above, which implies C{\begin{minted}{fortran}} and C{\end{minted}} as
begin and end for blocks inside C{!bc fpro} and C{!ec}).  Specifying
C{envir=ans:nt} means that all other environments are typeset with the
C{anslistings.sty} package, e.g., C{!bc cppcod} will then result in
C{\begin{c++}}. If no environments like C{sys}, C{fpro}, or the common
C{envir} are defined on the command line, the plain C{\begin{verbatim}}
and C{\end{verbatim}} used.


I{Step 2b (optional).} Edit the C{mydoc.tex} file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute C{section} by C{section*} to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the C{doconce replace} and C{doconce subst}
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples::


        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

I{Step 3.} Compile C{mydoc.tex}
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc


If one wishes to run C{ptex2tex} and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (C{Minted_Python}, C{Minted_Cpp}, etc., in
C{ptex2tex} specified through the C{*pro} and C{*cod} variables in
C{.ptex2tex.cfg} or C{$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg}), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running C{ptex2tex} with the
C{-DMINTED} option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, C{latex} must be run with the
C{-shell-escape} option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

When running C{doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted} (or other minted
specifications with C{doconce ptex2tex}), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the C{-DMINTED} option.


PDFLaTeX
--------

Running C{pdflatex} instead of C{latex} follows almost the same steps,
but the start is::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then C{ptex2tex} is run as explained above, and finally::


        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file C{mydoc.rst}::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice


The OpenOffice file C{mydoc.odt} can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program C{unovonv}
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports I{on the command line}.
Run::


        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
C{mydoc.odt} to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF::


        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt


I{Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.} At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by C{latex} as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the C{sphinx} output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the C{doconce sphinx_dir} command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords C{author}, C{title}, and C{version} are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, C{version} is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files C{file1},
C{file2}, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files C{file1}, C{file2}, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of C{dirname} is C{sphinx-rootdir}. The C{theme}
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is C{'default'}).

With a single-file document in C{mydoc.do.txt} one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory C{sphinx-rootdir} is made with
relevant files.

The C{doconce sphinx_dir} command generates a script
C{automake_sphinx.py} for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run C{automake_sphinx.py} or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The C{doconce sphinx_dir} script copies directories named C{figs} or
C{figures} over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, C{automake_sphinx.py} must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not C{http:} or C{file:} URLs), must be
placed in the C{_static} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility C{doconce sphinxfix_localURLs} is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say C{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt} it
replaces the link by C{_static/myfile.txt} and copies
C{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt} to a local C{_static} directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in C{_static} or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all C{_static/*} files to the
C{_static} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a C{_static} or C{_static-name} directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the C{conf.py}
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
C{make-themes.sh} can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes C{fenics} and C{pyramid}, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are C{_build/html_fenics}
and C{_build/html_pyramid}, respectively. Without arguments,
C{make-themes.sh} makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file C{mydoc.do.txt}.

I{Step 1.} Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


I{Step 2.} Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive C{sphinx-quickstart}
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated C{conf.py} file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The C{doconce sphinx_dir} generator makes an extended C{conv.py}
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


I{Step 3.} Copy the C{mydoc.rst} file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with C{mydoc.rst} in the C{sphinx-rootdir}
directory. Either edit C{mydoc.rst} so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to C{sphinx-rootdir}.
Links to local files in C{mydoc.rst} must be modified to links to
files in the C{_static} directory, see comment above.

I{Step 4.} Edit the generated C{index.rst} file so that C{mydoc.rst}
is included, i.e., add C{mydoc} to the C{toctree} section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before C{mydoc} are important!)

I{Step 5.} Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with C{index.html} files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

I{Step 6.} View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows C{!bc}: C{cod} gives Python
(C{code-block:: python} in Sphinx syntax) and C{cppcod} gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
U{Googlecode wiki<http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>}, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
C{gwiki}, C{mwiki}, and C{cwiki}, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt


The Googlecode wiki document, C{mydoc.gwiki}, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the C{.gwiki} file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of U{mwlib<http://pediapress.com/code/>}. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write U{Wikibooks<http://en.wikibooks.org>}
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
C{.rst} file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if C{.eps} or C{.png} is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The C{make.sh} files in C{docs/manual} and C{docs/tutorial}
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file C{make.sh} in the C{tutorial} directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, C{tutorial.do.txt} is the
starting point.  Running C{make.sh} and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original C{tutorial.do.txt} file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
U{Here<https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>}
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the C{docs/manual} directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, C{manual.do.txt}, to
various formats. The C{make.sh} script runs a set of translations.

Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies
============================================

Doconce
-------

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at U{http://code.google.com/p/doconce<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>}.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (C{hg}) source follows the standard procedure::


        # Doconce
        hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version::


        cd doconce
        hg pull
        hg update
        sudo python setup.py install


Debian GNU/Linux users can also run::


        sudo apt-get install doconce

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run::


        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install doconce


Dependencies
------------

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the U{Preprocess<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>}
preprocessor, this program must be installed::


        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
U{Mako<http://www.makotemplates.org>}. Its installation is most
conveniently done by C{pip}::


        pip install Mako

This command requires C{pip} to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by::


        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the C{pip} U{source code<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>}.

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need U{ptex2tex<http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>},
which is installed by::


        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, C{cp2texmf.sh}::


        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that C{ptex2tex} potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by::


        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the C{~/texmf/tex/latex/misc} directory).

Note that the C{doconce ptex2tex} command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the C{ptex2tex}
program.

The I{minted} LaTeX style is offered by C{ptex2tex} and C{doconce ptext2tex}
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package U{Pygments<http://pygments.org>}
to be installed::


        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install


If you use the minted style together with C{ptex2tex}, you have to
enable it by the C{-DMINTED} command-line argument to C{ptex2tex}.  All
use of the minted style requires the C{-shell-escape} command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., C{latex -shell-escape} or C{pdflatex
-shell-escape}.


reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The C{rst} output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the U{docutils<http://docutils.sourceforge.net>} package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by::


        svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install::


        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths


There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
U{rst2pdf<http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf>}. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the C{rst2pdf} directory and
run the usual C{sudo python setup.py install}.


Output to C{sphinx} requires of course U{Sphinx<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>},
installed by::


        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce format C{pandoc} outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the C{pandoc} program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of U{Pandoc<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>}, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by::


        sudo apt-get install pandoc


Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is C{epydoc} one needs that program too, installed
by::


        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..


I{Remark.} Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
C{apt-get install} command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For C{svn} directories, go to the directory,
run C{svn update}, and then C{sudo python setup.py install}. For
Mercurial (C{hg}) directories, go to the directory, run
C{hg pull; hg update}, and then C{sudo python setup.py install}.

Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
========================================

Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2] 

[1] Simula Research Laboratory
[2] University of Oslo


Date: Jan 32, 2100

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like LaTeX (http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf), HTML (http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/), reStructuredText (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html), Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html), and wiki (http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax)? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


The Doconce Concept
===================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via rst2* programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via unoconv) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



What Does Doconce Look Like?
============================

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.

  * Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.

  * *Emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks.

  * _Words in boldface_ are surrounded by underscores.

  * Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset verbatim (in a monospace font).

  * Section headings are recognied by equality (=) signs before
    and after the title, and the number of = signs indicates the
    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and
    3 for subsubsection.

  * Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading.

  * The abstract of a document starts with *Abstract* as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,

  * Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    !bc (begin code) and !ec (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block.

  * Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.

  * Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    !bt (begin TeX) and !et (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block.

  * There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.

  * Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.

  * Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout
    the text.

  * Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can
    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such
    comments).

  * There is special support for advanced exercises features.

  * With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text.

  * With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format::


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and computer words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1

  * item 2

  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an o
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1

 2. item 2

 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl).
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in tutorial.do.txt.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section "A Subsection with Sample Text".

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x),
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as::


        $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
  !bt and !et (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this::

        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes latex, pdflatex, html, and sphinx). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
  !bc and !ec instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like::


        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to sphinx, rst, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., !bc xxx
where xxx is an identifier like pycod for code snippet in Python,
sys for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ptex2tex and defined in a
configuration file .ptext2tex.cfg, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments)::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, pro and cod are python, sys is console,
while xpro and xcod are computer language specific for x
in f (Fortran), c (C), cpp (C++), pl (Perl), m (Matlab),
sh (Unix shells), cy (Cython), and py (Python).


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with !bc pro, while a part of a file is copied into a !bc cod
environment. What pro and cod mean is then defined through
a .ptex2tex.cfg file for LaTeX and a sphinx code-blocks
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing #include "mynote.do.txt"
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension do.txt. The do part stands for doconce, while the
trailing .txt denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
newcommand_replace.tex are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names newcommands.tex and
newcommands_keep.tex are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
  !bt and !et in newcommands_keep.tex to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
newcommands_replace.tex and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the newcommands*.tex files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the doc/manual/manual.do.txt file (see the
demo page (https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html)
for various formats of this document).




From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document mydoc.do.txt to various other
formats applies the script doconce format::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The mako or preprocess programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to mako or preprocess can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable FORMAT is always defined as the current format when
running preprocess. That is, in the last example, FORMAT is
defined as latex. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like #if FORMAT == "latex".

The command-line arguments --no-preprocess and --no-mako turn off
running preprocess and mako, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file mydoc.do.txt
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file mydoc.html can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the pygmentize program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument --no-pygments-html
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain <pre> HTML tags. The option --pygments-html-linenos turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": %(title)s for a title,
%(date)s for a date, and %(main)s for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
DATE: line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert %(title)s and
%(date)s at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by %(main)s. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html


Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is mydoc.mkd.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats::


        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd

Pandoc supports latex, html, odt (OpenOffice), docx (Microsoft
Word), rtf, texinfo, to mention some. The -R option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the --toc option generates a table of contents.
See the Pandoc documentation (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html)
for the many features of the pandoc program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
doconce format pandoc and then translating using pandoc, or
doconce format latex, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using pandoc.
Here is an example on the latter strategy::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through pandoc, only single equations or align*
environments are well understood.

Quite some doconce replace and doconce subst edits might be needed
on the .mkd or .tex files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd

The -s option adds a proper header and footer to the mydoc.html file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file mydoc.tex from mydoc.do.txt is done in two steps:

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form mydoc.p.tex for
the ptex2tex program (or doconce ptex2tex)::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files newcommands.tex, newcommands_keep.tex, or
newcommands_replace.tex (see the section "Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ptex2tex (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have ptex2tex, you may run a (very) simplified version::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc


Note that Doconce generates a .p.tex file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 * BOOK for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)

 * PALATINO for the Palatino font

 * HELVETIA for the Helvetica font

 * A4PAPER for A4 paper size

 * A6PAPER for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)

 * MOVIE15 for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies

 * PREAMBLE to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)

 * MINTED for inclusion of the minted package (which requires latex
   or pdflatex to be run with the -shell-escape option)

The ptex2tex tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any !bc command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your .ptex2tex.cfg
file, e.g., !bc sys for a terminal session, where sys is set to
a certain environment in .ptex2tex.cfg (e.g., CodeTerminal).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the doconce ptex2tex command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the .p.tex file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
                  -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that @ must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as minted
above, which implies \begin{minted}{fortran} and \end{minted} as
begin and end for blocks inside !bc fpro and !ec).  Specifying
envir=ans:nt means that all other environments are typeset with the
anslistings.sty package, e.g., !bc cppcod will then result in
\begin{c++}. If no environments like sys, fpro, or the common
envir are defined on the command line, the plain \begin{verbatim}
and \end{verbatim} used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the mydoc.tex file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute section by section* to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the doconce replace and doconce subst
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples::


        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile mydoc.tex
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc


If one wishes to run ptex2tex and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (Minted_Python, Minted_Cpp, etc., in
ptex2tex specified through the *pro and *cod variables in
.ptex2tex.cfg or $HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running ptex2tex with the
-DMINTED option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, latex must be run with the
-shell-escape option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

When running doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted (or other minted
specifications with doconce ptex2tex), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the -DMINTED option.


PDFLaTeX
--------

Running pdflatex instead of latex follows almost the same steps,
but the start is::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then ptex2tex is run as explained above, and finally::


        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file mydoc.rst::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice


The OpenOffice file mydoc.odt can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program unovonv
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run::


        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
mydoc.odt to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF::


        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt


*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by latex as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the sphinx output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the doconce sphinx_dir command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords author, title, and version are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, version is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files file1,
file2, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files file1, file2, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of dirname is sphinx-rootdir. The theme
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is 'default').

With a single-file document in mydoc.do.txt one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory sphinx-rootdir is made with
relevant files.

The doconce sphinx_dir command generates a script
automake_sphinx.py for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run automake_sphinx.py or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The doconce sphinx_dir script copies directories named figs or
figures over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, automake_sphinx.py must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not http: or file: URLs), must be
placed in the _static subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility doconce sphinxfix_localURLs is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say dir1/dir2/myfile.txt it
replaces the link by _static/myfile.txt and copies
dir1/dir2/myfile.txt to a local _static directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in _static or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all _static/* files to the
_static subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a _static or _static-name directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the conf.py
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
make-themes.sh can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes fenics and pyramid, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are _build/html_fenics
and _build/html_pyramid, respectively. Without arguments,
make-themes.sh makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file mydoc.do.txt.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive sphinx-quickstart
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated conf.py file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The doconce sphinx_dir generator makes an extended conv.py
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the mydoc.rst file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with mydoc.rst in the sphinx-rootdir
directory. Either edit mydoc.rst so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to sphinx-rootdir.
Links to local files in mydoc.rst must be modified to links to
files in the _static directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated index.rst file so that mydoc.rst
is included, i.e., add mydoc to the toctree section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before mydoc are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with index.html files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows !bc: cod gives Python
(code-block:: python in Sphinx syntax) and cppcod gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
Googlecode wiki (http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax), MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
gwiki, mwiki, and cwiki, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt


The Googlecode wiki document, mydoc.gwiki, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the .gwiki file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of mwlib (http://pediapress.com/code/). This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write Wikibooks (http://en.wikibooks.org)
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
.rst file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if .eps or .png is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The make.sh files in docs/manual and docs/tutorial
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file make.sh in the tutorial directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, tutorial.do.txt is the
starting point.  Running make.sh and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original tutorial.do.txt file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
Here (https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html)
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the docs/manual directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, manual.do.txt, to
various formats. The make.sh script runs a set of translations.

Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies
============================================

Doconce
-------

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at http://code.google.com/p/doconce.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (hg) source follows the standard procedure::


        # Doconce
        hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version::


        cd doconce
        hg pull
        hg update
        sudo python setup.py install


Debian GNU/Linux users can also run::


        sudo apt-get install doconce

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run::


        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install doconce


Dependencies
------------

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the Preprocess (http://code.google.com/p/preprocess)
preprocessor, this program must be installed::


        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
Mako (http://www.makotemplates.org). Its installation is most
conveniently done by pip::


        pip install Mako

This command requires pip to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by::


        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the pip source code (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need ptex2tex (http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex),
which is installed by::


        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, cp2texmf.sh::


        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that ptex2tex potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by::


        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the ~/texmf/tex/latex/misc directory).

Note that the doconce ptex2tex command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the ptex2tex
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by ptex2tex and doconce ptext2tex
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package Pygments (http://pygments.org)
to be installed::


        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install


If you use the minted style together with ptex2tex, you have to
enable it by the -DMINTED command-line argument to ptex2tex.  All
use of the minted style requires the -shell-escape command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., latex -shell-escape or pdflatex
-shell-escape.


reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rst output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the docutils (http://docutils.sourceforge.net) package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by::


        svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install::


        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths


There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
rst2pdf (http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf). Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the rst2pdf directory and
run the usual sudo python setup.py install.


Output to sphinx requires of course Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org),
installed by::


        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce format pandoc outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the pandoc program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of Pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), written in Haskell, is most
easily done by::


        sudo apt-get install pandoc


Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is epydoc one needs that program too, installed
by::


        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..


*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
apt-get install command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For svn directories, go to the directory,
run svn update, and then sudo python setup.py install. For
Mercurial (hg) directories, go to the directory, run
hg pull; hg update, and then sudo python setup.py install.

% Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
% Hans Petter Langtangen at Simula Research Laboratory and University of Oslo
% Jan 32, 2100

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like [LaTeX](http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf), [HTML](http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/), [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html), [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html), and [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax)? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


The Doconce Concept
===================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via `rst2*` programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via `unoconv`) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



What Does Doconce Look Like?
============================

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. Here are
som examples.

  * Bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk.

  * *Emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks.

  * _Words in boldface_ are surrounded by underscores.

  * Words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset `verbatim (in a monospace font)`.

  * Section headings are recognied by equality (`=`) signs before
    and after the title, and the number of `=` signs indicates the
    level of the section: 7 for main section, 5 for subsection, and
    3 for subsubsection.

  * Paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading.

  * The abstract of a document starts with *Abstract* as paragraph
    heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,

  * Blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    `!bc` (begin code) and `!ec` (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block.

  * Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.

  * Blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    `!bt` (begin TeX) and `!et` (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block.

  * There is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics.

  * Figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported.

  * Invisible comments in the output format can be inserted throughout
    the text.

  * Visible comments can be inserted so that authors and readers can
    comment upon the text (and at any time turn on/off output of such
    comments).

  * There is special support for advanced exercises features.

  * With a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text.

  * With the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
\label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1

  * item 2

  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an `o`
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1

 2. item 2

 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in [hpl](http://folk.uio.no/hpl).
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in <tutorial.do.txt>.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section [A Subsection with Sample Text](#t).

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section [From Doconce to Other Formats](#s) for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,


    time        velocity    acceleration  
------------  ------------  ------------  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  


Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as $\nu = \sin(x)$,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like $\nu = \sin(x)$ is
typeset as

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
`!bt` and `!et` (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
$$
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
$$
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes `latex`, `pdflatex`, `html`, and `sphinx`). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
`!bc` and `!ec` instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to `sphinx`, `rst`, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., `!bc xxx`
where `xxx` is an identifier like `pycod` for code snippet in Python,
`sys` for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in `ptex2tex` and defined in a
configuration file `.ptext2tex.cfg`, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, `pro` and `cod` are `python`, `sys` is `console`,
while `xpro` and `xcod` are computer language specific for `x`
in `f` (Fortran), `c` (C), `cpp` (C++), `pl` (Perl), `m` (Matlab),
`sh` (Unix shells), `cy` (Cython), and `py` (Python).


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with `!bc pro`, while a part of a file is copied into a `!bc cod`
environment. What `pro` and `cod` mean is then defined through
a `.ptex2tex.cfg` file for LaTeX and a `sphinx code-blocks`
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing `#include "mynote.do.txt"`
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension `do.txt`. The `do` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing `.txt` denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the `doc/manual/manual.do.txt` file (see the
[demo page](https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html)
for various formats of this document).




From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document `mydoc.do.txt` to various other
formats applies the script `doconce format`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

or just

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `mako` or `preprocess` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to `mako` or `preprocess` can be added after the
filename. For example,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The variable `FORMAT` is always defined as the current format when
running `preprocess`. That is, in the last example, `FORMAT` is
defined as `latex`. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like `#if FORMAT == "latex"`.

The command-line arguments `--no-preprocess` and `--no-mako` turn off
running `preprocess` and `mako`, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file `mydoc.do.txt`
is performed by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The resulting file `mydoc.html` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the `pygmentize` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument `--no-pygments-html`
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain `<pre>` HTML tags. The option `--pygments-html-linenos` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": `%(title)s` for a title,
`%(date)s` for a date, and `%(main)s` for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
`DATE:` line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert `%(title)s` and
`%(date)s` at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by `%(main)s`. Here is an example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name of the output file is `mydoc.mkd`.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pandoc supports `latex`, `html`, `odt` (OpenOffice), `docx` (Microsoft
Word), `rtf`, `texinfo`, to mention some. The `-R` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the `--toc` option generates a table of contents.
See the [Pandoc documentation](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html)
for the many features of the `pandoc` program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
`doconce format pandoc` and then translating using `pandoc`, or
`doconce format latex`, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using `pandoc`.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we go through `pandoc`, only single equations or `align*`
environments are well understood.

Quite some `doconce replace` and `doconce subst` edits might be needed
on the `.mkd` or `.tex` files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `-s` option adds a proper header and footer to the `mydoc.html` file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file `mydoc.tex` from `mydoc.do.txt` is done in two steps:

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form `mydoc.p.tex` for
the `ptex2tex` program (or `doconce ptex2tex`):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files `newcommands.tex`, `newcommands_keep.tex`, or
`newcommands_replace.tex` (see the section [Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography](#y)).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run `ptex2tex` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you do not have `ptex2tex`, you may run a (very) simplified version:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that Doconce generates a `.p.tex` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through `-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional`.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
`-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage`.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 * `BOOK` for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)

 * `PALATINO` for the Palatino font

 * `HELVETIA` for the Helvetica font

 * `A4PAPER` for A4 paper size

 * `A6PAPER` for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)

 * `MOVIE15` for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies

 * `PREAMBLE` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)

 * `MINTED` for inclusion of the minted package (which requires `latex`
   or `pdflatex` to be run with the `-shell-escape` option)

The `ptex2tex` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any `!bc` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your `.ptex2tex.cfg`
file, e.g., `!bc sys` for a terminal session, where `sys` is set to
a certain environment in `.ptex2tex.cfg` (e.g., `CodeTerminal`).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the `doconce ptex2tex` command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the `.p.tex` file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that `@` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as `minted`
above, which implies `\begin{minted}{fortran}` and `\end{minted}` as
begin and end for blocks inside `!bc fpro` and `!ec`).  Specifying
`envir=ans:nt` means that all other environments are typeset with the
`anslistings.sty` package, e.g., `!bc cppcod` will then result in
`\begin{c++}`. If no environments like `sys`, `fpro`, or the common
`envir` are defined on the command line, the plain `\begin{verbatim}`
and `\end{verbatim}` used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the `mydoc.tex` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute `section` by `section*` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst`
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile `mydoc.tex`
and create the PDF file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If one wishes to run `ptex2tex` and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (`Minted_Python`, `Minted_Cpp`, etc., in
`ptex2tex` specified through the `*pro` and `*cod` variables in
`.ptex2tex.cfg` or `$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg`), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running `ptex2tex` with the
`-DMINTED` option:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case, `latex` must be run with the
`-shell-escape` option:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running `doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted` (or other minted
specifications with `doconce ptex2tex`), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the `-DMINTED` option.


PDFLaTeX
--------

Running `pdflatex` instead of `latex` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then `ptex2tex` is run as explained above, and finally

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file `mydoc.rst`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may now produce various other formats:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenOffice file `mydoc.odt` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program `unovonv`
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> unoconv --show
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
`mydoc.odt` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by `latex` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the `sphinx` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the `doconce sphinx_dir` command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The keywords `author`, `title`, and `version` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, `version` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files `file1`,
`file2`, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files `file1`, `file2`, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of `dirname` is `sphinx-rootdir`. The `theme`
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is `'default'`).

With a single-file document in `mydoc.do.txt` one often just runs

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory `sphinx-rootdir` is made with
relevant files.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` command generates a script
`automake_sphinx.py` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run `automake_sphinx.py` or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` script copies directories named `figs` or
`figures` over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, `automake_sphinx.py` must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not `http:` or `file:` URLs), must be
placed in the `_static` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility `doconce sphinxfix_localURLs` is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say `dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` it
replaces the link by `_static/myfile.txt` and copies
`dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` to a local `_static` directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in `_static` or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all `_static/*` files to the
`_static` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a `_static` or `_static-name` directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the `conf.py`
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
`make-themes.sh` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes `fenics` and `pyramid`, one writes

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The resulting directories with HTML documents are `_build/html_fenics`
and `_build/html_pyramid`, respectively. Without arguments,
`make-themes.sh` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file `mydoc.do.txt`.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive `sphinx-quickstart`
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The autogenerated `conf.py` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The `doconce sphinx_dir` generator makes an extended `conv.py`
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the `mydoc.rst` file to the Sphinx root directory:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with `mydoc.rst` in the `sphinx-rootdir`
directory. Either edit `mydoc.rst` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to `sphinx-rootdir`.
Links to local files in `mydoc.rst` must be modified to links to
files in the `_static` directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated `index.rst` file so that `mydoc.rst`
is included, i.e., add `mydoc` to the `toctree` section so that it becomes

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(The spaces before `mydoc` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with `index.html` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows `!bc`: `cod` gives Python
(`code-block:: python` in Sphinx syntax) and `cppcod` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
[Googlecode wiki](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax), MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
`gwiki`, `mwiki`, and `cwiki`, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Googlecode wiki document, `mydoc.gwiki`, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the `.gwiki` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of [mwlib](http://pediapress.com/code/). This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write [Wikibooks](http://en.wikibooks.org)
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
`.rst` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if `.eps` or `.png` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The `make.sh` files in `docs/manual` and `docs/tutorial`
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file `make.sh` in the `tutorial` directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, `tutorial.do.txt` is the
starting point.  Running `make.sh` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original `tutorial.do.txt` file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
[Here](https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html)
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the `docs/manual` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, `manual.do.txt`, to
various formats. The `make.sh` script runs a set of translations.

Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies
============================================

Doconce
-------

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at <http://code.google.com/p/doconce>.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (`hg`) source follows the standard procedure:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo apt-get install doconce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependencies
------------

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the [Preprocess](http://code.google.com/p/preprocess)
preprocessor, this program must be installed:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
[Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org). Its installation is most
conveniently done by `pip`,


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
pip install Mako
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This command requires `pip` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo apt-get install python-pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, one can install from the `pip` [source code](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need [ptex2tex](http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex),
which is installed by


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, `cp2texmf.sh`:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the `~/texmf/tex/latex/misc` directory).

Note that the `doconce ptex2tex` command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the `ptex2tex`
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by `ptex2tex` and `doconce ptext2tex`
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package [Pygments](http://pygments.org)
to be installed:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use the minted style together with `ptex2tex`, you have to
enable it by the `-DMINTED` command-line argument to `ptex2tex`.  All
use of the minted style requires the `-shell-escape` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., `latex -shell-escape` or `pdflatex
-shell-escape`.


reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `rst` output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the [docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net) package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
[rst2pdf](http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf). Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the `rst2pdf` directory and
run the usual `sudo python setup.py install`.


Output to `sphinx` requires of course [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org),
installed by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce format `pandoc` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the `pandoc` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), written in Haskell, is most
easily done by


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo apt-get install pandoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is `epydoc` one needs that program too, installed
by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
`apt-get install` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For `svn` directories, go to the directory,
run `svn update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`. For
Mercurial (`hg`) directories, go to the directory, run
`hg pull; hg update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`.

************** File: ../_what_is.do.txt *****************
Doconce is two things:

  o Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via `rst2*` programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via `unoconv`) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

  o Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".



Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.
  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



************** File: ../_doconce2anything.do.txt *****************

======= From Doconce to Other Formats =======
label{doconce2formats}

Transformation of a Doconce document `mydoc.do.txt` to various other
formats applies the script `doconce format`:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
!ec
or just
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
!ec
The `mako` or `preprocess` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to `mako` or `preprocess` can be added after the
filename. For example,
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
!ec
The variable `FORMAT` is always defined as the current format when
running `preprocess`. That is, in the last example, `FORMAT` is
defined as `latex`. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like `#if FORMAT == "latex"`.

The command-line arguments `--no-preprocess` and `--no-mako` turn off
running `preprocess` and `mako`, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
!ec
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
!bc
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
!ec
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


===== HTML =====

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file `mydoc.do.txt`
is performed by
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
!ec
The resulting file `mydoc.html` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the `pygmentize` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument `--no-pygments-html`
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain `<pre>` HTML tags. The option `--pygments-html-linenos` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": `%(title)s` for a title,
`%(date)s` for a date, and `%(main)s` for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
`DATE:` line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert `%(title)s` and
`%(date)s` at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by `%(main)s`. Here is an example:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
!ec

===== Pandoc and Markdown =====

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
!ec
The name of the output file is `mydoc.mkd`.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
!bc sys
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
!ec
Pandoc supports `latex`, `html`, `odt` (OpenOffice), `docx` (Microsoft
Word), `rtf`, `texinfo`, to mention some. The `-R` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the `--toc` option generates a table of contents.
See the "Pandoc documentation": "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html"
for the many features of the `pandoc` program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
`doconce format pandoc` and then translating using `pandoc`, or
`doconce format latex`, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using `pandoc`.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
!ec
When we go through `pandoc`, only single equations or `align*`
environments are well understood.

Quite some `doconce replace` and `doconce subst` edits might be needed
on the `.mkd` or `.tex` files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
!ec
The `-s` option adds a proper header and footer to the `mydoc.html` file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


===== LaTeX =====

Making a LaTeX file `mydoc.tex` from `mydoc.do.txt` is done in two steps:
# Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many
# formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph
# environment, as used here.

__Step 1.__ Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form `mydoc.p.tex` for
the `ptex2tex` program (or `doconce ptex2tex`):
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
!ec
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files `newcommands.tex`, `newcommands_keep.tex`, or
`newcommands_replace.tex` (see Section ref{newcommands}).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

__Step 2.__ Run `ptex2tex` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
!bc sys
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
!ec
In case you do not have `ptex2tex`, you may run a (very) simplified version:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
!ec

Note that Doconce generates a `.p.tex` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
!bc sys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
!ec
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through `-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional`.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
`-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage`.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 * `BOOK` for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 * `PALATINO` for the Palatino font
 * `HELVETIA` for the Helvetica font
 * `A4PAPER` for A4 paper size
 * `A6PAPER` for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 * `MOVIE15` for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 * `PREAMBLE` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)
 * `MINTED` for inclusion of the minted package (which requires `latex`
   or `pdflatex` to be run with the `-shell-escape` option)

The `ptex2tex` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any `!bc` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your `.ptex2tex.cfg`
file, e.g., `!bc sys` for a terminal session, where `sys` is set to
a certain environment in `.ptex2tex.cfg` (e.g., `CodeTerminal`).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the `doconce ptex2tex` command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the `.p.tex` file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
!ec
Note that `@` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as `minted`
above, which implies `\begin{minted}{fortran}` and `\end{minted}` as
begin and end for blocks inside `!bc fpro` and `!ec`).  Specifying
`envir=ans:nt` means that all other environments are typeset with the
`anslistings.sty` package, e.g., `!bc cppcod` will then result in
`\begin{c++}`. If no environments like `sys`, `fpro`, or the common
`envir` are defined on the command line, the plain `\begin{verbatim}`
and `\end{verbatim}` used.


__Step 2b (optional).__ Edit the `mydoc.tex` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute `section` by `section*` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst`
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
!ec
A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

__Step 3.__ Compile `mydoc.tex`
and create the PDF file:
!bc sys
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
!ec

If one wishes to run `ptex2tex` and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (`Minted_Python`, `Minted_Cpp`, etc., in
`ptex2tex` specified through the `*pro` and `*cod` variables in
`.ptex2tex.cfg` or `$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg`), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running `ptex2tex` with the
`-DMINTED` option:
!bc sys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
!ec
In this case, `latex` must be run with the
`-shell-escape` option:
!bc sys
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
!ec
When running `doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted` (or other minted
specifications with `doconce ptex2tex`), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the `-DMINTED` option.


===== PDFLaTeX =====

Running `pdflatex` instead of `latex` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
!ec
Then `ptex2tex` is run as explained above, and finally
!bc sys
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
!ec

===== Plain ASCII Text =====

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
!ec

===== reStructuredText =====

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file `mydoc.rst`:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
!ec
We may now produce various other formats:
!bc sys
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
!ec

The OpenOffice file `mydoc.odt` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program `unovonv`
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run
!bc sys
Terminal> unoconv --show
!ec
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
`mydoc.odt` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
!bc sys
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
!ec

__Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.__
At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by `latex` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the `sphinx` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

===== Sphinx =====

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the `doconce sphinx_dir` command:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
!ec
The keywords `author`, `title`, and `version` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, `version` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files `file1`,
`file2`, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files `file1`, `file2`, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of `dirname` is `sphinx-rootdir`. The `theme`
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is `'default'`).

With a single-file document in `mydoc.do.txt` one often just runs
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
!ec
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory `sphinx-rootdir` is made with
relevant files.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` command generates a script
`automake_sphinx.py` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run `automake_sphinx.py` or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` script copies directories named `figs` or
`figures` over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, `automake_sphinx.py` must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not `http:` or `file:` URLs), must be
placed in the `_static` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility `doconce sphinxfix_localURLs` is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say `dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` it
replaces the link by `_static/myfile.txt` and copies
`dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` to a local `_static` directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in `_static` or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all `_static/*` files to the
`_static` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a `_static` or `_static-name` directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the `conf.py`
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
`make-themes.sh` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes `fenics` and `pyramid`, one writes
!bc sys
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
!ec
The resulting directories with HTML documents are `_build/html_fenics`
and `_build/html_pyramid`, respectively. Without arguments,
`make-themes.sh` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file `mydoc.do.txt`.

__Step 1.__ Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
!ec

__Step 2.__ Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive `sphinx-quickstart`
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
!bc sys
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
!ec
The autogenerated `conf.py` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The `doconce sphinx_dir` generator makes an extended `conv.py`
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


__Step 3.__ Copy the `mydoc.rst` file to the Sphinx root directory:
!bc sys
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
!ec
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with `mydoc.rst` in the `sphinx-rootdir`
directory. Either edit `mydoc.rst` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to `sphinx-rootdir`.
Links to local files in `mydoc.rst` must be modified to links to
files in the `_static` directory, see comment above.

__Step 4.__ Edit the generated `index.rst` file so that `mydoc.rst`
is included, i.e., add `mydoc` to the `toctree` section so that it becomes
!bc
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
!ec
(The spaces before `mydoc` are important!)

__Step 5.__ Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
!bc sys
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
!ec

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with `index.html` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

__Step 6.__ View the result:
!bc sys
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
!ec

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows `!bc`: `cod` gives Python
(`code-block:: python` in Sphinx syntax) and `cppcod` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


===== Wiki Formats =====

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
"Googlecode wiki": "http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax", MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
`gwiki`, `mwiki`, and `cwiki`, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
!bc sys
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
!ec

The Googlecode wiki document, `mydoc.gwiki`, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the `.gwiki` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of "mwlib": "http://pediapress.com/code/". This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write "Wikibooks": "http://en.wikibooks.org"
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


===== Tweaking the Doconce Output =====

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
`.rst` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if `.eps` or `.png` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The `make.sh` files in `docs/manual` and `docs/tutorial`
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

<TITLE>Demo of Doconce formats</TITLE>
<H3>Doconce demo</H3>

Doconce is a minimum tagged markup language. The file
<a href="manual.do.txt">manual.do.txt</a> is the source of
a Doconce Description, written in the Doconce format.
Running
<pre>
doconce format html manual.do.txt
</pre>
produces the HTML file <a href="manual.html">manual.html</a>.
Going from Doconce to LaTeX is done by
<pre>
doconce format latex manual.do.txt
</pre>
resulting in the file <a href="manual.tex">manual.tex</a>, which can
be compiled to a PDF file <a href="manual.pdf">manual.pdf</a>
by running <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>dvipdf</tt> the standard way.
<p>
The reStructuredText (reST) format is of particular interest:
<pre>
doconce format rst    manual.do.txt  # standard reST
doconce format sphinx manual.do.txt  # Sphinx extension of reST
</pre>
The reST file <a href="manual.rst">manual.rst</a> is a starting point
for conversion to many other formats: OpenOffice,
<a href="manual.xml">XML</a>, <a href="manual.rst.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="manual.rst.tex">LaTeX</a>,
and from LaTeX to <a href="manual.rst.pdf">PDF</a>.
The <a href="manual.sphinx.rst">Sphinx</a> dialect of reST
can be translated to <a href="manual.sphinx.pdf">PDF</a>
and <a href="html/index.html">HTML</a>.
<p>
Doconce can also be converted to
<a href="manual.gwiki">Googlecode wiki</a>,
<a href="manual.cwiki">Creole wiki</a>,
<a href="manual.mwiki">MediaWiki</a>,
<a href="manual.mkd">Markdown</a> (Pandoc extended version),
<a href="manual.st">Structured Text</a>,
<a href="manual.epytext">Epytext</a>,
and maybe the most important format of all:
<a href="manual.txt">plain untagged ASCII text</a>.

# #include "../tutorial/_what_is.do.txt"

# #include "install.do.txt"

#
# Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting
# these lines are converted to comments in the output format.

# One can use ## and the mako preprocessor to remove comments
# *before* doconce sees the text. That can be useful when
# doconce comments interferes with formatting.
# The mako tool also supports <%doc> .. </%doc>

===== Demos =====

idx{demos}

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the
!bc sys
docs/manual/manual.do.txt
!ec
file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
"demo web page": "https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html"
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file `make.sh` in the same directory as the `manual.do.txt` file
(the current text) shows how to run `doconce format` on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in
!bc sys
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
!ec
In the `tutorial` directory there is also a `make.sh` file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
"web demo": "https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html"
of the results.

# Example on including another Doconce file:

# #include "../tutorial/_doconce2anything.do.txt"



======= The Doconce Markup Language =======

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

===== Lists =====

An unordered bullet list makes use of the `*` as bullet sign
and is indented as follows

!bc
   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3
!ec

This list gets typeset as

   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3

# #if FORMAT == "gwiki"
(As seen, nested lists in (g)wiki format are not treated well by
Doconce. Plain unnested lists work fine. And the (g)wiki format
automatically puts multiple lines of an item on a single line as
required :-)
# #endif

In an ordered list, each item starts with an `o` (as the first letter
in "ordered"):

!bc
   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3
!ec

resulting in

   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3

# #if FORMAT == "gwiki"
(Again, there are problems with mixing nested lists and liststypes
for the (g)wiki format.)
# #endif

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:

!bc
   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)
!ec

The result becomes

   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)


===== Special Lines =====

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.

idx{`TITLE` keyword} idx{`AUTHOR` keyword} idx{`DATE` keyword}

__Heading with Title and Author(s).__
Lines starting with `TITLE:`, `AUTHOR:`, and `DATE:` are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax
!bc
name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3
!ec
The `at` with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the `and` with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax
!bc
name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2
!ec
Multiple authors require multiple `AUTHOR:` lines. All information
associated with `TITLE:` and `AUTHOR:` keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:
!bc
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: November 9, 2016
!ec
Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including `rst` and `sphinx`)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:
!bc
Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
A. Dummy Author

[1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
[2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
[3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
!ec
Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as `today`.

idx{`TOC` keyword}

__Table of Contents.__
A table of contents can be generated by the line
!bc
TOC: on
!ec
This line is usually placed after the `DATE:` line.
A value `off` turns off the table of contents.

idx{headlines} idx{section headings}

__Section Headings.__
Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   * 9 `=` characters for chapters
   * 7 for sections
   * 5 for subsections
   * 3 for subsubsections
   * 2 *underscrores* (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
*must* be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples:
!bc
__Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
various section headings.

========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========

Some text.


======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.


===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====

The running text goes here.

===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.
!ec

======= Special Lines =======

===== Figures =====

# Note: need extra blank after FIGURE and MOVIE in !bc environments
# because doconce treats !ec as part of the caption and moves the
# !ec up to the caption line

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax
!bc
FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

!ec
The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say `.eps` when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's `convert` utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for `TITLE:` and `AUTHOR:` lines, all information
related to a figure line *must be written on the same line*. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as `FIGURE:` will be
included in the formatted caption).

FIGURE:[figs/streamtubes, width=400] Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. label{fig:viz}

Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
`montage` program from the ImageMagick suite:
!bc sys
montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
        file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png
!ec
The option `-tile XxY` gives `X` figures in the horizontal direction and
`Y` in the vertical direction (`tile 2x` means two figures per row
and `-tile x2` means two rows).

===== Movies =====

Here is an example on the `MOVIE:` keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the `latex`, `html`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.
!bc
MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption

!ec

# latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies,
# or just plain \href{run: ...}{...}

MOVIE: [figs/mjolnir.mpeg, width=600 height=470]

#MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470]

#MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470]

The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the `movie15` package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable `MOVIE15`. There is an associated variable
`EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER` which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):
!bc sys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc
!ec

The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
`myframes*.png`. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the `MOVIE:` command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



===== Copying Computer Code from Source Files =====

Another type of special lines starts with `@@@CODE` and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
Section ref{sec:verbatim:blocks} below.


===== Inline Tagging =====
label{inline:tagging}
idx{inline tagging} idx{emphasized words} idx{boldface words} idx{verbatim text}
idx{inline comments}

Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, _boldface phrases_,
and `verbatim text` (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in
!bc
*emphasized words*
!ec

Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:
!bc
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.
!ec
The line above gets typeset as
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks:
!bc
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.
!ec
The typesetting result looks like this:
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and `ptex2tex`) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as
!bc
some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
!ec
which appears as some URL like "Search Google": "http://google.com".
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in `.txt`, `.html`, `.pdf`, `.py`, `.f`,
`.f77`, `.f90`, `.f95`, `.sh`, `.csh`, `.ksh`, `.zsh`,
`.c`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.pl`, and `.java` follows the same
setup:
!bc
see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".
!ec
which appears as see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:

  * In the `html` format the links work well if the files are
    supplied with the `.html` with the same relative location.
  * In the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats, such links in PDF files
    will unless the `.tex` file has a full URL specified through
    a `\hyperbaseurl` command and the linked files are located correctly
    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.
  * In the `sphinx` format, local files to which there are links should only be
    located in a `_static` or `_static-name` subdirectory.

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a `_static` or `_static-name` directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (`name` is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the `html` format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
`pygmentize`, e.g.,
!bc sys
Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
          -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh
!ec
Then you can link to `_static/make.sh.html` instead of
`subdir/make.sh`. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as `src/myprog.py` in her
software and the document links to `_static/myprog.py`:
!bc
See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").
!ec

Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
*the filename as link text*. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:
!bc
URL: "manual.html"
!ec
resulting in the link URL: "manual.html".

# This is now automatically carried out by the autogenerated
# script for sphinx:
#For such local links to
#work with the `sphinx` format, the `.rst` file needs a fix, carried
#out by
#!bc sys
#doconce sphinxfix_localURLs mydoc.rst
#!ec
#(The files, such as `manual.html`, are then copied to a subdirectory
#`_static`, which must be manually copied to the Sphinx directory's
#`_static` directory - links in the `.rst` files are automatically
#adjusted.)

Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:
!bc
Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".
!ec
resulting in Click on this link: URL: "http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:
!bc
[name: comment]
!ec
where `name` is the name of the author of the command, and `comment` is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless `doconce format`
is run with a command-line argument `--skip_inline_comments`
(see Chapter ref{doconce2formats} for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the `.do.txt` file
(see Chapter ref{doconce2formats}).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII:

!bc
Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.
!ec
That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (`latex`, `pdflatex`, `html`,
`sphinx`, `mwiki`), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$, where $\bf A$|$A$
is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$
are vectors of length $n$|$n$."

===== Comments ======

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as *inline comments* in Doconce and described
in Section ref{inline:tagging}.

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash `#`:
!bc
#
# Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
# These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
#
!ec
Such comment lines may have some side effects in the `rst` and `sphinx`
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out *before*
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash `##` and lines enclosed by
the `<%doc>` (beginning) and `<%doc/>` (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.


===== Cross-Referencing =====
idx{cross referencing} idx{labels} idx{references}

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:
!bc
label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.
!ec
This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
`rst` and `sphinx` formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by `doconce format`. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure ref{fig:viz}
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to Sections ref{mathtext} and ref{newcommands} are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say (ref{my:eq1})--(ref{my:eq2}). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in Section ref{inline:tagging}.

===== Index and Bibliography =====
idx{index} idx{citations} idx{bibliography}

An index can be created for the `latex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats
by the `idx` keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:
!bc
idx{some index entry}
idx{main entry!subentry}
idx{`verbatim_text` and more}
!ec
The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to
!bc
\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}
!ec
Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: `idx`
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:
!bc
as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.
!ec
Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding `cite` command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like
!bc
as found in [3][14]
!ec
if `Larsen_1986` has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and `Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999` is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword `BIBFILE:`,
followed by a BibTeX file with extension `.bib`,
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension `.rst`,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension `.py`.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,
!bc
{
'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
""",
'Larsen_1986':
"""
O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
*Personal Press*. 1986.
"""
}
!ec

In the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats, the `.bib` file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the `rst` and `sphinx` formats, the
`.rst` file will be copied into the document at the place where the
`BIBFILE:` keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the `BIBFILE:` line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is `myfile.bib`.
Insert `BIBFILE: myfile.bib` at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the `.rst` file, either by manual editing
of `myfile.bbl` or using `doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl` to automate (most of)
this editing. From the `myfile.rst` file it is easy to create `myfile.py`
with the dictionary version of the references.

# see ketch/tex2rst for nice bibtex to rst converter which could
# be used here

Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the "bibliograph.parsing":"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/" tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book cite{Python:Primer:09}, a paper cite{Osnes:98},
and both of them simultaneously cite{Python:Primer:09,Osnes:98}.

[somereader: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) ]


===== Tables =====

A table like

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--r--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:
!bc
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
!ec
The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters `c`, `r`, or `l` to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes `|` can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (`rst` and `sphinx` are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



===== Exercises, Problems, or Projects =====

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
*exercise*, *problem*, or *project*.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 `=` characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this:
!bc
===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{proj:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf
solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt

Here goes the running text of the project....

!ec
Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project *title*,
the *label*, the *result file*, the *solution* (if any of
these three entities is present), and the *running text*. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with `!bsubex` and ending
with `!esubex`, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) *answer*, and *hints*. The environments have begin-end
directives `!bans`, `!eans`, `!bsol`, `!esol`, `!bhint`, `!ehint`, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
`!bc` and `!ec`).

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the `solution=...` directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows:
!bc
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf

Here goes the running text of the project....

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
!ec

The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file `.mydoc.exerinfo`,
if `mydoc.do.txt` is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The *title* is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem ref{...}"
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".


===== Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code =====
label{sec:verbatim:blocks}

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" `!bc` keyword and an "end code" `!ec` keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the `!bc` tag to specify a
certain environment (for `ptex2tex` or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, `!bc dat` corresponds to
the data file environment and `!bc cod` is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for `ptex2tex` this means the `ccq` environment,
which is defined in the config file `.ptex2tex.cfg`,
while for Sphinx it defaults to the `python` environment).

Since the config file for `ptex2tex` can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after `!bc` is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.,
!bc
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
!ec
Here, three arguments are defined: `pycod` for Python code,
`cod` also for Python code, `cppcod` for C++ code, and `sys`
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in `.ptex2tex.cfg` for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, `pro` is used for complete programs in Python, `cod` is
for a code snippet in Python, while `xcod` and `xpro` implies computer
language specific typesetting where `x` can be `f` for Fortran, `c`
for C, `cpp` for C++, `sh` for Unix shells, `pl` for Perl, `m` for
Matlab, `cy` for Cython, and `py` for Python.  The argument `sys`
means by default `console` for Sphinx and `CodeTerminal` (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are `dat` for a data file
or print out, and `ipy` for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in `sphinx` output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after `!bc` can be redefined in the
`.ptex2tex.cfg` configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
`sphinx code-blocks` comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.

# (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code
# blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments
# and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the
# first one is used.)

The enclosing `!ec` tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (`pycod` style):
!bc pycod
# regular expressions for inline tags:
inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
INLINE_TAGS = {
    'emphasize':
    r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'verbatim':
    r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'bold':
    r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
}
!ec
And here is a C++ code snippet (`cppcod` style):
!bc cppcod
void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
        myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
    }
}
!ec

# When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise
# ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then
!bc
 @@@CODE myfile.f
 @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1
!ec
The first line implies that all lines in the file `myfile.f` are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a `!bc Xpro` environment, where
`X` is the extension of the filename, here `f` (i.e., the environment
becomes `!bc fpro` and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a `fromto:` directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, `X` is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the `pro` and `cod` arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain `!bc` environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
`@` sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching `subroutine test`
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching `C END1` (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):

@@@CODE __testcode.f

Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the `fromto:`
directive above:

@@@CODE __testcode.f fromto:subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing `fromto:` by
`from-to` ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text
!bc cod
# --- Start Example 1 ---
c = -1
A = 2
p0 = 4
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 1 ---

# --- Start Example 2 ---
c = -1
A = 1
p0 = 0
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 2 ---
!ec
is easy with
!bc
from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2
!ec
With only `fromto:` this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with `ptex2tex`: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in `ptex2tex`. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
`.p.tex` file to be treated by `ptex2tex`. However, the `@@@CODE` line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the `ptex2tex` configuration
file.)


===== LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text =====
label{mathtext}

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is `!bt` (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
`!et`. It is important that `!bt` and `!et` appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.
!bc
!bt
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
!et
!ec
Here is the result of the above `!bt` - `!et` block:
!bt
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
!et

The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
`latex` and `pdflatex` has of course full support. The `html` format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although `sphinx`, like `html`, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
(`pandoc` format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the `latex` format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After `#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")` one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
`#else` one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.


=== Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice ===

If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.

  o Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.
  o Go to the Sphinx directory and load the `conf.py` file into
    a browser.
  o Search for "math" and comment out the
    `'sphinx.ext.mathjax'` (enabled by default) and
    `'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'` (disabled by default)
    lines, and uncomment the `'sphinx.ext.pngmath'` package.
    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures
    of the mathematics.
  o Uncomment the line with `pngmath_dvipng_args =` and
    set the PNG resolution to `-D 200` when the purpose is to
    generate mathematics pictures for slides.
  o Run `make html`.
  o Look at the HTML source file in the `_build/html`
    directory: all mathematics are in `img` tags with `src=`
    pointing to a PNG file and `alt=` pointing to the LaTeX
    source for the formula in question. This makes it very
    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular
    mathematical expression.


===== Macros (Newcommands) =====
label{newcommands}

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

__Example.__ Suppose we have the following commands in
`newcommand_replace.tex`:

@@@CODE newcommands_replace.tex

and these in `newcommands_keep.tex`:

@@@CODE newcommands_keep.tex

The LaTeX block
!bc
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
!ec
will then be rendered to
!bt
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
!et
in the current format.

===== Preprocessing Steps =====

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(URL:"http://code.google.com/p/preprocess") and mako
(URL:"http://www.makotemplates.org/"). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of `name=value` command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable `FORMAT`
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (`html`, `latex`,
`plain`, `rst`, `sphinx`, `epydoc`, `st`).  It is then easy to test on
the value of `FORMAT` and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example:

@@@CODE _format_specific1.do.txt

Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in Section ref{doconce2formats}.

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



===== Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces =====

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form `#include "file.do.txt"`.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate `.rst` files and an index file listing the various `.rst`
that build up the document. To generate the various `.rst` files one
should not run Doconce on the individual `.do.txt` files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script `doconce split_rst`
to split the long, complete `.rst` into pieces. This process requires
that each `#include "file.do.txt` line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax `#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>`, where
`file` is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword `part:`.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is `master.do.txt`.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run
!bc cod
doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake_sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi
!ec
The autogenerated `automake_sphinx.sh` file (by `doconce sphinx_dir`)
is compatible with a master `.rst` file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to `doconce sphinx_dir`.
This set is the output of `doconce split_rst`, which we catch in a
variable `files` above.


===== Missing Features =====

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line

@@@CODE _format_specific2.do.txt

Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say
!bc
# table of contents
!ec
we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce `doconce format latex mydoc` to produce `mydoc.p.tex`. Then
we use the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst` commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:
!bc
Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
!ec
The `doconce replace from_text to_text filename` command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the `replace` method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with `\tableofcontents`, we should use `doconce subst`,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:
!bc
Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
!ec
Note the double backshlash in front of the `t` character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The `doconce subst` is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

===== Header and Footer =====

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if `TITLE:` or
`#TITLE:` is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


===== Emacs Doconce Formatter =====

The file `misc/.doconce-mode.el` in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

__Step 1.__ Download the Doconce tarball from `code.google.com/p/doconce`,
pack it out and go to the root directory.

__Step 2.__ Copy the `doconce-mode.el` file to the home directory:
!bc
cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME
!ec

__Step 3.__ Add these lines to `$HOME/.emacs`:
!bc
(load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
(setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))
!ec
Emacs will now recognize files with extension `.do.txt` and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.


======= Troubleshooting =======

===== Disclaimer =====

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running `doconce format`, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


===== General Problems ======

=== Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step ===

Doconce automatically removes the file `__tmp.do.txt`, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when `mako` and/or
`preprocess` is run). Add the `--debug` flag at the end of the
`doconce` command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
`__tmp.do.txt` is deleted.

=== Figure captions are incomplete ===

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

=== Preprocessor directives do not work ===

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

=== Problems with boldface and emphasize ===

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

=== Links to local directories do not work ===

Links of the type
!bc
see the "examples directory": "src/examples"
!ec
do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file:
!bc
see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"
!ec

=== Links are not typeset correctly ===

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim:
!bc
see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".
!ec
However, the following will not be typeset correctly:
!bc
see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"
!ec
The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.


=== Inline verbatim code is not detected ===

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

=== Strange non-English characters ===

Check the encoding of the `.do.txt` file with the Unix `file` command
or with
!bc
Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
!ec
If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands
!bc
Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt

Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
!ec

=== Wrong Norwegian charcters ===

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run `doconce change_encoding` to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

=== Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly ===

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

=== Too short underlining of reST headlines ===

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.


=== Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG) ===

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first `!bt` (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

===== Problems with code or Tex Blocks =====

=== Code or math block errors in reST ===

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a `!bc`, which should have been removed when
running `doconce format sphinx`, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then `!bc` will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

=== Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST ===

If `idx` commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

=== Something is wrong with a verbatim code block ===

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

=== Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format ===

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before `!bt` and `!bc` environments.

=== Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly ===

Read the Section ref{sec:verbatim:blocks} above.  Start the
`!bc` and `!ec` tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

=== LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly ===

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the `!bt` and `!et` tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


===== Problems with reST/Sphinx Output ======

=== Lists do not appear in .rst files ===

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

=== Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST ===

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

=== Warning about duplicate link names ===

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

=== Inconsistent headings in reST ===

The `rst2*.py` and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for `===`,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

=== No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks ===

The `!bc ipy` directive behaves this way for `sphinx` output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to `!bc cod` or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

===== Problems with LaTeX Output ======

=== Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed ===

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the `-shell-escape` command-line argument when
running `latex` or `pdflatex`:
!bc sys
Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
!ec
Using `doconce ptex2tex` will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using `ptex2tex` requires the
preprocessor option `-DMINTED` to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, `latex` or `pdflatex` runs the
`pygmentize` program and the `shell-escape` option is required.

=== How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments? ===

Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via `doconce replace`. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code:

!bc
<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.
!ec
The `.p.tex` output file now reads
!bc
% begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
!ec
Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the `% begin ...` and `% end ...` lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the `.p.tex` file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with *Theorem*.
The following Bash script does the job:
!bc shpro
file=mydoc.p.tex
thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file
!ec
More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
`mydoc.p.tex` file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting `mydoc.tex` file now becomes
!bc
\usepackage{theorem}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]

...

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
!ec
Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the `ptex2tex` program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).


=== The LaTeX file does not compile ===

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
!bc
\code{...}
!ec
the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

=== Inline verbatim gives error  ===

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.,
!bc
some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
then replace this by
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
capture the second }
!ec
The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.

# Could have doconce configure file where inline verbatim is
# configured to be \fontsize... directly, not via ptex2tex \code{}.


=== Errors in figure captions ===

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper `texttt` command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

=== Chapters are ignored ===

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run `ptex2tex` with the option `-DBOOK` to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

=== I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file ===

The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:

 o Make a little Bash script that performs a series of
   `doconce subst` (regular expressions) or `doconce replace` (regular text)
   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to
   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).
 o Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate
   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then
   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This
   means that the `doconce format latex` command does not generate
   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these
   files.
   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro
   text and include the various text pieces in this file.
   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files
   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the
   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but
   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.

===== Problems with gwiki Output ======

=== Strange nested lists in gwiki ===

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the `.gwiki` file directly.

=== Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source ===

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

===== Problems with HTML Output ======

=== How can I change the layout of the HTML page? ===

The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out `TITLE:` to get HTML without a header and footer). The
`--html-template=filename` command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title (`%(title)s`),
a date (`%(date)s`), and the main body of text (`%(main)s`).
For typesetting code, `pygments` is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by `--no-pygments-html` (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the `sphinx` format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via `doconce replace` and
`doconce subst` in the script that generates the final documents).

=== Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates? ===

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script:

!bc
doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
 '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
 '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html
!ec


===== Debugging =====

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
`_doconce_debugging.log`, if the to `doconce format` after the filename
is `debug`. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



======= Basic Parsing Ideas =======

# avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea)

The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression

!bc
(?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?
!ec

That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


===== Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables =====

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that `argument`, `keyword argument`, `return`,
`instance variable`, `class variable`, and `module variable` are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.

!bc
    - argument x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
    - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
    - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
    - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
    - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
      (bool variable).
!ec

The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    - module variable x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - module variable tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

<h2>What Is Doconce? <a name="what:is:doconce"></a>  <a name="___sec0"></a></h2>
<p>

<p>
Doconce is two things:

<p>

<ol>
 <li> Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via <tt>rst2*</tt> programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via <tt>unoconv</tt>) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.
 <li> Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".
</ol>

Here are some Doconce features:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  <li> Doconce can be converted to plain <em>untagged</em> text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  <li> Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.
  <li> Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  <li> Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  <li> Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.
</ul>

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  <li> Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  <li> Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.
</ul>

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

<p>
Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get install doconce
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h3>Dependencies  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>
<p>

<h4>Preprocessors  <a name="___sec4"></a></h4>
<p>
If you make use of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess">Preprocess</a>
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
<a href="http://www.makotemplates.org">Mako</a>. Its installation is most
conveniently done by <tt>pip</tt>,

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
pip install Mako
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This command requires <tt>pip</tt> to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-pip
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Alternatively, one can install from the <tt>pip</tt> <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">source code</a>.

<p>

<h4>Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output  <a name="___sec5"></a></h4>
<p>
To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex">ptex2tex</a>,
which is installed by

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, <tt>cp2texmf.sh</tt>:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that <tt>ptex2tex</tt> potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the <tt>~/texmf/tex/latex/misc</tt> directory).

<p>
Note that the <tt>doconce ptex2tex</tt> command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the <tt>ptex2tex</tt>
program.

<p>
The <em>minted</em> LaTeX style is offered by <tt>ptex2tex</tt> and <tt>doconce ptext2tex</tt>
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package <a href="http://pygments.org">Pygments</a>
to be installed:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
If you use the minted style together with <tt>ptex2tex</tt>, you have to
enable it by the <tt>-DMINTED</tt> command-line argument to <tt>ptex2tex</tt>.  All
use of the minted style requires the <tt>-shell-escape</tt> command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., <tt>latex -shell-escape</tt> or <tt>pdflatex
-shell-escape</tt>.

<p>
<!-- Say something about anslistings.sty -->

<p>

<h4>reStructuredText (reST) Output  <a name="___sec6"></a></h4>
<p>
The <tt>rst</tt> output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net">docutils</a> package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf">rst2pdf</a>. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the <tt>rst2pdf</tt> directory and
run the usual <tt>sudo python setup.py install</tt>.

<p>

<p>
Output to <tt>sphinx</tt> requires of course <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org">Sphinx</a>,
installed by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h4>Markdown and Pandoc Output  <a name="___sec7"></a></h4>
<p>
The Doconce format <tt>pandoc</tt> outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the <tt>pandoc</tt> program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a>, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
sudo apt-get install pandoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h4>Epydoc Output  <a name="___sec8"></a></h4>
<p>
When the output format is <tt>epydoc</tt> one needs that program too, installed
by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<b>Remark.</b> Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
<tt>apt-get install</tt> command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For <tt>svn</tt> directories, go to the directory,
run <tt>svn update</tt>, and then <tt>sudo python setup.py install</tt>. For
Mercurial (<tt>hg</tt>) directories, go to the directory, run
<tt>hg pull; hg update</tt>, and then <tt>sudo python setup.py install</tt>.

<p>

<p>
<!--  -->
<!-- Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting -->
<!-- these lines are converted to comments in the output format. -->
<!-- This may have some side effects, especially in rst and sphinx -->
<!-- where lines following the comment may be taken as part of -->
<!-- the comment if there are no blank lines after the comment. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- One can use ## and the mako preprocessor to remove comments -->
<!-- <em>before</em> doconce sees the text. That can be useful when -->
<!-- doconce comments interferes with formatting. -->
<!-- The mako tool also supports <%doc> .. </%doc> -->

<h3>Demos  <a name="___sec9"></a></h3>
<p>

<p>
The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
docs/manual/manual.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
<a href="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html">demo web page</a>
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

<p>
The file <tt>make.sh</tt> in the same directory as the <tt>manual.do.txt</tt> file
(the current text) shows how to run <tt>doconce format</tt> on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

<p>
Another demo is found in
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
In the <tt>tutorial</tt> directory there is also a <tt>make.sh</tt> file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
<a href="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html">web demo</a>
of the results.

<p>
<!-- Example on including another Doconce file: -->

<p>

<p>

<h2>From Doconce to Other Formats <a name="doconce2formats"></a>  <a name="___sec10"></a></h2>
<p>

<p>
Transformation of a Doconce document <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt> to various other
formats applies the script <tt>doconce format</tt>:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
or just
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format format mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>mako</tt> or <tt>preprocess</tt> programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to <tt>mako</tt> or <tt>preprocess</tt> can be added after the
filename. For example,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The variable <tt>FORMAT</tt> is always defined as the current format when
running <tt>preprocess</tt>. That is, in the last example, <tt>FORMAT</tt> is
defined as <tt>latex</tt>. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like <tt>#if FORMAT == "latex"</tt>.

<p>
The command-line arguments <tt>--no-preprocess</tt> and <tt>--no-mako</tt> turn off
running <tt>preprocess</tt> and <tt>mako</tt>, respectively.

<p>
Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

<p>

<p>

<h3>HTML  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>
<p>
Making an HTML version of a Doconce file <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt>
is performed by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format html mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The resulting file <tt>mydoc.html</tt> can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

<p>
If the Pygments package (including the <tt>pygmentize</tt> program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument <tt>--no-pygments-html</tt>
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain <tt><pre></tt> HTML tags. The option <tt>--pygments-html-linenos</tt> turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

<p>
The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": <tt>%(title)s</tt> for a title,
<tt>%(date)s</tt> for a date, and <tt>%(main)s</tt> for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
<tt>DATE:</tt> line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert <tt>%(title)s</tt> and
<tt>%(date)s</tt> at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by <tt>%(main)s</tt>. Here is an example:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h3>Pandoc and Markdown  <a name="___sec12"></a></h3>
<p>
Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The name of the output file is <tt>mydoc.mkd</tt>.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Pandoc supports <tt>latex</tt>, <tt>html</tt>, <tt>odt</tt> (OpenOffice), <tt>docx</tt> (Microsoft
Word), <tt>rtf</tt>, <tt>texinfo</tt>, to mention some. The <tt>-R</tt> option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the <tt>--toc</tt> option generates a table of contents.
See the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc documentation</a>
for the many features of the <tt>pandoc</tt> program.

<p>
Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
<tt>doconce format pandoc</tt> and then translating using <tt>pandoc</tt>, or
<tt>doconce format latex</tt>, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using <tt>pandoc</tt>.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal&gt; pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
When we go through <tt>pandoc</tt>, only single equations or <tt>align*</tt>
environments are well understood.

<p>
Quite some <tt>doconce replace</tt> and <tt>doconce subst</tt> edits might be needed
on the <tt>.mkd</tt> or <tt>.tex</tt> files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

<p>
Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal&gt; pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>-s</tt> option adds a proper header and footer to the <tt>mydoc.html</tt> file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

<p>

<p>

<h3>LaTeX  <a name="___sec13"></a></h3>
<p>
Making a LaTeX file <tt>mydoc.tex</tt> from <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt> is done in two steps:
<!-- Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many -->
<!-- formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph -->
<!-- environment, as used here. -->

<p>
<b>Step 1.</b> Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form <tt>mydoc.p.tex</tt> for
the <tt>ptex2tex</tt> program (or <tt>doconce ptex2tex</tt>):
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files <tt>newcommands.tex</tt>, <tt>newcommands_keep.tex</tt>, or
<tt>newcommands_replace.tex</tt> (see the section <a href="#newcommands">Macros (Newcommands)</a>).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

<p>
<b>Step 2.</b> Run <tt>ptex2tex</tt> (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; ptex2tex mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
In case you do not have <tt>ptex2tex</tt>, you may run a (very) simplified version:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Note that Doconce generates a <tt>.p.tex</tt> file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through <tt>-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional</tt>.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
<tt>-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage</tt>.

<p>
Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

<p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>BOOK</tt> for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 <li> <tt>PALATINO</tt> for the Palatino font
 <li> <tt>HELVETIA</tt> for the Helvetica font
 <li> <tt>A4PAPER</tt> for A4 paper size
 <li> <tt>A6PAPER</tt> for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 <li> <tt>MOVIE15</tt> for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 <li> <tt>PREAMBLE</tt> to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)
 <li> <tt>MINTED</tt> for inclusion of the minted package (which requires <tt>latex</tt>
   or <tt>pdflatex</tt> to be run with the <tt>-shell-escape</tt> option)
</ul>

The <tt>ptex2tex</tt> tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any <tt>!bc</tt> command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your <tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt>
file, e.g., <tt>!bc sys</tt> for a terminal session, where <tt>sys</tt> is set to
a certain environment in <tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt> (e.g., <tt>CodeTerminal</tt>).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

<p>
Also the <tt>doconce ptex2tex</tt> command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the <tt>.p.tex</tt> file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Note that <tt>@</tt> must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as <tt>minted</tt>
above, which implies <tt>\begin{minted}{fortran}</tt> and <tt>\end{minted}</tt> as
begin and end for blocks inside <tt>!bc fpro</tt> and <tt>!ec</tt>).  Specifying
<tt>envir=ans:nt</tt> means that all other environments are typeset with the
<tt>anslistings.sty</tt> package, e.g., <tt>!bc cppcod</tt> will then result in
<tt>\begin{c++}</tt>. If no environments like <tt>sys</tt>, <tt>fpro</tt>, or the common
<tt>envir</tt> are defined on the command line, the plain <tt>\begin{verbatim}</tt>
and <tt>\end{verbatim}</tt> used.

<p>

<p>
<b>Step 2b (optional).</b> Edit the <tt>mydoc.tex</tt> file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute <tt>section</tt> by <tt>section*</tt> to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the <tt>doconce replace</tt> and <tt>doconce subst</tt>
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal&gt; doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g&lt;1&gt; \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g&lt;2&gt;' mydoc.tex
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

<p>
<b>Step 3.</b> Compile <tt>mydoc.tex</tt>
and create the PDF file:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal&gt; bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal&gt; latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; dvipdf mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
If one wishes to run <tt>ptex2tex</tt> and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (<tt>Minted_Python</tt>, <tt>Minted_Cpp</tt>, etc., in
<tt>ptex2tex</tt> specified through the <tt>*pro</tt> and <tt>*cod</tt> variables in
<tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt> or <tt>$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg</tt>), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running <tt>ptex2tex</tt> with the
<tt>-DMINTED</tt> option:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
In this case, <tt>latex</tt> must be run with the
<tt>-shell-escape</tt> option:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal&gt; bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; dvipdf mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
When running <tt>doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted</tt> (or other minted
specifications with <tt>doconce ptex2tex</tt>), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the <tt>-DMINTED</tt> option.

<p>

<p>

<h3>PDFLaTeX  <a name="___sec14"></a></h3>
<p>
Running <tt>pdflatex</tt> instead of <tt>latex</tt> follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Then <tt>ptex2tex</tt> is run as explained above, and finally
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal&gt; bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal&gt; pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h3>Plain ASCII Text  <a name="___sec15"></a></h3>
<p>
We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h3>reStructuredText  <a name="___sec16"></a></h3>
<p>
Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file <tt>mydoc.rst</tt>:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
We may now produce various other formats:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; rst2html.py  mydoc.rst &gt; mydoc.html # html
Terminal&gt; rst2latex.py mydoc.rst &gt; mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal&gt; rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst &gt; mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal&gt; rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst &gt; mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The OpenOffice file <tt>mydoc.odt</tt> can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program <tt>unovonv</tt>
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports <em>on the command line</em>.
Run
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; unoconv --show
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
<tt>mydoc.odt</tt> to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal&gt; unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal&gt; unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<b>Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.</b> At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by <tt>latex</tt> as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the <tt>sphinx</tt> output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

</ul>

<h3>Sphinx  <a name="___sec17"></a></h3>
<p>
Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the <tt>doconce sphinx_dir</tt> command:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The keywords <tt>author</tt>, <tt>title</tt>, and <tt>version</tt> are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, <tt>version</tt> is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files <tt>file1</tt>,
<tt>file2</tt>, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files <tt>file1</tt>, <tt>file2</tt>, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of <tt>dirname</tt> is <tt>sphinx-rootdir</tt>. The <tt>theme</tt>
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is <tt>'default'</tt>).

<p>
With a single-file document in <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt> one often just runs
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory <tt>sphinx-rootdir</tt> is made with
relevant files.

<p>
The <tt>doconce sphinx_dir</tt> command generates a script
<tt>automake_sphinx.py</tt> for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run <tt>automake_sphinx.py</tt> or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

<p>
The <tt>doconce sphinx_dir</tt> script copies directories named <tt>figs</tt> or
<tt>figures</tt> over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, <tt>automake_sphinx.py</tt> must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not <tt>http:</tt> or <tt>file:</tt> URLs), must be
placed in the <tt>_static</tt> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility <tt>doconce sphinxfix_localURLs</tt> is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say <tt>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</tt> it
replaces the link by <tt>_static/myfile.txt</tt> and copies
<tt>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</tt> to a local <tt>_static</tt> directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in <tt>_static</tt> or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all <tt>_static/*</tt> files to the
<tt>_static</tt> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a <tt>_static</tt> or <tt>_static-name</tt> directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

<p>
Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the <tt>conf.py</tt>
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
<tt>make-themes.sh</tt> can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes <tt>fenics</tt> and <tt>pyramid</tt>, one writes
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The resulting directories with HTML documents are <tt>_build/html_fenics</tt>
and <tt>_build/html_pyramid</tt>, respectively. Without arguments,
<tt>make-themes.sh</tt> makes all available themes (!).

<p>
If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt>.

<p>
<b>Step 1.</b> Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format sphinx mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<b>Step 2.</b> Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive <tt>sphinx-quickstart</tt>
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart &lt;&lt;EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The autogenerated <tt>conf.py</tt> file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The <tt>doconce sphinx_dir</tt> generator makes an extended <tt>conv.py</tt>
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.

<p>

<p>
<b>Step 3.</b> Copy the <tt>mydoc.rst</tt> file to the Sphinx root directory:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with <tt>mydoc.rst</tt> in the <tt>sphinx-rootdir</tt>
directory. Either edit <tt>mydoc.rst</tt> so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to <tt>sphinx-rootdir</tt>.
Links to local files in <tt>mydoc.rst</tt> must be modified to links to
files in the <tt>_static</tt> directory, see comment above.

<p>
<b>Step 4.</b> Edit the generated <tt>index.rst</tt> file so that <tt>mydoc.rst</tt>
is included, i.e., add <tt>mydoc</tt> to the <tt>toctree</tt> section so that it becomes
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
(The spaces before <tt>mydoc</tt> are important!)

<p>
<b>Step 5.</b> Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with <tt>index.html</tt> files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

<p>
<b>Step 6.</b> View the result:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; firefox _build/html/index.html
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows <tt>!bc</tt>: <tt>cod</tt> gives Python
(<tt>code-block:: python</tt> in Sphinx syntax) and <tt>cppcod</tt> gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Wiki Formats  <a name="___sec18"></a></h3>
<p>
There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax">Googlecode wiki</a>, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
<tt>gwiki</tt>, <tt>mwiki</tt>, and <tt>cwiki</tt>, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal&gt; doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal&gt; doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The Googlecode wiki document, <tt>mydoc.gwiki</tt>, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

<p>
When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the <tt>.gwiki</tt> file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

<p>
From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of <a href="http://pediapress.com/code/">mwlib</a>. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org">Wikibooks</a>
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Tweaking the Doconce Output  <a name="___sec19"></a></h3>
<p>
Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
<tt>.rst</tt> file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if <tt>.eps</tt> or <tt>.png</tt> is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The <tt>make.sh</tt> files in <tt>docs/manual</tt> and <tt>docs/tutorial</tt>
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

<p>

<p>

<p>

<h2>The Doconce Markup Language  <a name="___sec20"></a></h2>
<p>
The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

<p>

<h3>Lists  <a name="___sec21"></a></h3>
<p>
An unordered bullet list makes use of the <tt>*</tt> as bullet sign
and is indented as follows

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
This list gets typeset as

<p>

<ul>
   <li> item 1
   <li> item 2

<ul>
     <li> subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here
     <li> subitem 2,
       also spans two lines
</ul>

   <li> item 3
</ul>

In an ordered list, each item starts with an <tt>o</tt> (as the first letter
in "ordered"):

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
resulting in

<p>

<ol>
  <li> item 1
  <li> item 2

<ul>
     <li> subitem 1
     <li> subitem 2
</ul>

  <li> item 3
</ol>

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

<p>
In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The result becomes

<p>

<dl>
   <dt>keyword1:<dd> 
     explanation of keyword1
   <dt>keyword2:<dd> 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)
</dl>

<h3>Special Lines  <a name="___sec22"></a></h3>
<p>
The Doconce markup language has a concept called <em>special lines</em>.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.

<p>

<p>
<b>Heading with Title and Author(s).</b> Lines starting with <tt>TITLE:</tt>, <tt>AUTHOR:</tt>, and <tt>DATE:</tt> are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>at</tt> with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the <tt>and</tt> with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Multiple authors require multiple <tt>AUTHOR:</tt> lines. All information
associated with <tt>TITLE:</tt> and <tt>AUTHOR:</tt> keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: November 9, 2016
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including <tt>rst</tt> and <tt>sphinx</tt>)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
A. Dummy Author

[1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
[2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
[3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

<p>
The current date can be specified as <tt>today</tt>.

<p>

<p>
<b>Table of Contents.</b> A table of contents can be generated by the line
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
TOC: on
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This line is usually placed after the <tt>DATE:</tt> line.
A value <tt>off</tt> turns off the table of contents.

<p>

<p>
<b>Section Headings.</b> Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

<p>

<ul>
   <li> 9 <tt>=</tt> characters for chapters
   <li> 7 for sections
   <li> 5 for subsections
   <li> 3 for subsubsections
   <li> 2 <em>underscrores</em> (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)
</ul>

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

<p>
Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
<em>must</em> be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).

<p>

<p>
Here are some examples:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
__Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
various section headings.

========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========

Some text.


======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.


===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====

The running text goes here.

===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h2>Special Lines  <a name="___sec22"></a></h2>
<p>

<h3>Figures  <a name="___sec24"></a></h3>
<p>
<!-- Note: need extra blank after FIGURE and MOVIE in !bc environments -->
<!-- because doconce treats !ec as part of the caption and moves the -->
<!-- !ec up to the caption line -->

<p>
Figures are recognized by the special line syntax
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say <tt>.eps</tt> when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's <tt>convert</tt> utility).

<p>
The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

<p>
Note also that, like for <tt>TITLE:</tt> and <tt>AUTHOR:</tt> lines, all information
related to a figure line <em>must be written on the same line</em>. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as <tt>FIGURE:</tt> will be
included in the formatted caption).

<p>

<p>
<center> <! -- figure -->
<hr class="figure">
<center><p class="caption">Figure 1:  Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. <a name="fig:viz"></a> </p></center>
<p><img src="figs/streamtubes.png" align="bottom" width=400></p>
</center>

<p>

<p>
Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
<tt>montage</tt> program from the ImageMagick suite:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
        file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The option <tt>-tile XxY</tt> gives <tt>X</tt> figures in the horizontal direction and
<tt>Y</tt> in the vertical direction (<tt>tile 2x</tt> means two figures per row
and <tt>-tile x2</tt> means two rows).

<p>

<h3>Movies  <a name="___sec25"></a></h3>
<p>
Here is an example on the <tt>MOVIE:</tt> keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the <tt>latex</tt>, <tt>html</tt>, <tt>rst</tt>, and <tt>sphinx</tt> formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption

</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<!-- latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies, -->
<!-- or just plain \href{run: ...}{...} -->

<p>

<embed src="figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=600 height=470 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
<p>
<em></em>
</p>


<p>
<!-- MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470] -->

<p>
<!-- MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470] -->

<p>
The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

<p>
When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the <tt>movie15</tt> package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable <tt>MOVIE15</tt>. There is an associated variable
<tt>EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER</tt> which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
<tt>myframes*.png</tt>. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

<p>
Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the <tt>MOVIE:</tt> command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).

<p>

<p>

<p>

<h3>Copying Computer Code from Source Files  <a name="___sec26"></a></h3>
<p>
Another type of special lines starts with <tt>@@@CODE</tt> and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section <a href="#sec:verbatim:blocks">Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code</a> below.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Inline Tagging <a name="inline:tagging"></a>  <a name="___sec27"></a></h3>
<p>

<p>
Doconce supports tags for <em>emphasized phrases</em>, <b>boldface phrases</b>,
and <tt>verbatim text</tt> (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as \( \nu = \sin(x) \).

<p>
Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
*emphasized words*
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The line above gets typeset as
<b>several words in boldface</b> followed by <em>ephasized text</em>.

<p>
Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The typesetting result looks like this:
<tt>call myroutine(a, b)</tt> looks like a Fortran call
while <tt>void myfunc(double *a, double *b)</tt> must be C.

<p>
It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and <tt>ptex2tex</tt>) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

<p>
Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

<p>
Web addresses with links are typeset as
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
which appears as some URL like <a href="http://google.com">Search Google</a>.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in <tt>.txt</tt>, <tt>.html</tt>, <tt>.pdf</tt>, <tt>.py</tt>, <tt>.f</tt>,
<tt>.f77</tt>, <tt>.f90</tt>, <tt>.f95</tt>, <tt>.sh</tt>, <tt>.csh</tt>, <tt>.ksh</tt>, <tt>.zsh</tt>,
<tt>.c</tt>, <tt>.cpp</tt>, <tt>.cxx</tt>, <tt>.pl</tt>, and <tt>.java</tt> follows the same
setup:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
which appears as see the <a href="manual.do.txt">Doconce Manual</a>.
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> In the <tt>html</tt> format the links work well if the files are
    supplied with the <tt>.html</tt> with the same relative location.
  <li> In the <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>pdflatex</tt> formats, such links in PDF files
    will unless the <tt>.tex</tt> file has a full URL specified through
    a <tt>\hyperbaseurl</tt> command and the linked files are located correctly
    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.
  <li> In the <tt>sphinx</tt> format, local files to which there are links should only be
    located in a <tt>_static</tt> or <tt>_static-name</tt> subdirectory.
</ul>

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a <tt>_static</tt> or <tt>_static-name</tt> directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (<tt>name</tt> is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the <tt>html</tt> format is of relevance).

<p>
If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
<tt>pygmentize</tt>, e.g.,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
          -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Then you can link to <tt>_static/make.sh.html</tt> instead of
<tt>subdir/make.sh</tt>. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as <tt>src/myprog.py</tt> in her
software and the document links to <tt>_static/myprog.py</tt>:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
<em>the filename as link text</em>. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
URL: "manual.html"
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
resulting in the link <a href="manual.html"><tt>manual.html</tt></a>.

<p>
<!-- This is now automatically carried out by the autogenerated -->
<!-- script for sphinx: -->
<!-- For such local links to -->
<!-- work with the <tt>sphinx</tt> format, the <tt>.rst</tt> file needs a fix, carried -->
<!-- out by -->
<!-- !bc sys -->
<!-- doconce sphinxfix_localURLs mydoc.rst -->
<!-- !ec -->
<!-- (The files, such as <tt>manual.html</tt>, are then copied to a subdirectory -->
<!-- <tt>_static</tt>, which must be manually copied to the Sphinx directory's -->
<!-- <tt>_static</tt> directory - links in the <tt>.rst</tt> files are automatically -->
<!-- adjusted.) -->

<p>
Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
resulting in Click on this link: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/doconce"><tt>http://code.google.com/p/doconce</tt></a>.

<p>
Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
[name: comment]
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
where <tt>name</tt> is the name of the author of the command, and <tt>comment</tt> is a
plain text text. [<b>hpl</b>: <em>Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.</em>]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless <tt>doconce format</tt>
is run with a command-line argument <tt>--skip_inline_comments</tt>
(see the chapter <a href="#doconce2formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</a> for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the <tt>.do.txt</tt> file
(see the chapter <a href="#doconce2formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</a>).

<p>
Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (<tt>latex</tt>, <tt>pdflatex</tt>, <tt>html</tt>,
<tt>sphinx</tt>, <tt>mwiki</tt>), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system \( {\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b} \), where \( \bf A \)
is an \( n\times n \) matrix, and \( \bf x \) and \( \bf b \)
are vectors of length \( n \)."

<p>

<h3>Comments  <a name="___sec28"></a></h3>
<p>
Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as <em>inline comments</em> in Doconce and described
in the section <a href="#inline:tagging">Inline Tagging</a>.

<p>
Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash <tt>#</tt>:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
#
# Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
# These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
#
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Such comment lines may have some side effects in the <tt>rst</tt> and <tt>sphinx</tt>
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

<p>
The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out <em>before</em>
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash <tt>##</tt> and lines enclosed by
the <tt><%doc></tt> (beginning) and <tt><%doc/></tt> (closing) tags.

<p>
If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Cross-Referencing  <a name="___sec29"></a></h3>
<p>
References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
\label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
<tt>rst</tt> and <tt>sphinx</tt> formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by <tt>doconce format</tt>. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

<p>
It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure <a href="fig:viz">1</a>
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections <a href="#mathtext">LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text</a> and <a href="#newcommands">Macros (Newcommands)</a> are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say \eqref{my:eq1}--\eqref{my:eq2}. A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

<p>
Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section <a href="#inline:tagging">Inline Tagging</a>.

<p>

<h3>Index and Bibliography  <a name="___sec30"></a></h3>
<p>
An index can be created for the <tt>latex</tt>, <tt>rst</tt>, and <tt>sphinx</tt> formats
by the <tt>idx</tt> keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
idx{some index entry}
idx{main entry!subentry}
idx{`verbatim_text` and more}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: <tt>idx</tt>
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

<p>
Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding <tt>cite</tt> command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
as found in [3][14]
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
if <tt>Larsen_1986</tt> has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and <tt>Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999</tt> is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

<p>
The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword <tt>BIBFILE:</tt>,
followed by a BibTeX file with extension <tt>.bib</tt>,
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension <tt>.rst</tt>,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension <tt>.py</tt>.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
{
'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
""",
'Larsen_1986':
"""
O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
*Personal Press*. 1986.
"""
}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
In the <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>pdflatex</tt> formats, the <tt>.bib</tt> file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the <tt>rst</tt> and <tt>sphinx</tt> formats, the
<tt>.rst</tt> file will be copied into the document at the place where the
<tt>BIBFILE:</tt> keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the <tt>BIBFILE:</tt> line in the document.

<p>
Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is <tt>myfile.bib</tt>.
Insert <tt>BIBFILE: myfile.bib</tt> at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the <tt>.rst</tt> file, either by manual editing
of <tt>myfile.bbl</tt> or using <tt>doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl</tt> to automate (most of)
this editing. From the <tt>myfile.rst</tt> file it is easy to create <tt>myfile.py</tt>
with the dictionary version of the references.

<p>
<!-- see ketch/tex2rst for nice bibtex to rst converter which could -->
<!-- be used here -->

<p>
Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/">bibliograph.parsing</a> tool.

<p>
Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book <a href="#Python:Primer:09">[1]</a>, a paper <a href="#Osnes:98">[2]</a>,
and both of them simultaneously <a href="#Python:Primer:09">[1]</a> <a href="#Osnes:98">[2]</a>.

<p>
[<b>somereader</b>: <em>comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) </em>]

<p>

<p>

<h3>Tables  <a name="___sec31"></a></h3>
<p>
A table like

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>    time    </b></td> <td align="center"><b>  velocity  </b></td> <td align="center"><b>acceleration</b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters <tt>c</tt>, <tt>r</tt>, or <tt>l</tt> to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes <tt>|</tt> can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (<tt>rst</tt> and <tt>sphinx</tt> are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.

<p>

<p>

<p>

<h3>Exercises, Problems, or Projects  <a name="___sec32"></a></h3>
<p>
Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
<em>exercise</em>, <em>problem</em>, or <em>project</em>.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 <tt>=</tt> characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
\label{proj:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf
solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt

Here goes the running text of the project....

</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project <em>title</em>,
the <em>label</em>, the <em>result file</em>, the <em>solution</em> (if any of
these three entities is present), and the <em>running text</em>. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with <tt>!bsubex</tt> and ending
with <tt>!esubex</tt>, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) <em>answer</em>, and <em>hints</em>. The environments have begin-end
directives <tt>!bans</tt>, <tt>!eans</tt>, <tt>!bsol</tt>, <tt>!esol</tt>, <tt>!bhint</tt>, <tt>!ehint</tt>, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
<tt>!bc</tt> and <tt>!ec</tt>).

<p>
The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the <tt>solution=...</tt> directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

<p>
A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
\label{exer:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf

Here goes the running text of the project....

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file <tt>.mydoc.exerinfo</tt>,
if <tt>mydoc.do.txt</tt> is the name of the Doconce file.

<p>
Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

<p>
For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The <em>title</em> is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem ref{...}"
works well in all formats.

<p>
It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".

<p>

<p>

<h3>Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code <a name="sec:verbatim:blocks"></a>  <a name="___sec33"></a></h3>
<p>

<p>
Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" <tt>!bc</tt> keyword and an "end code" <tt>!ec</tt> keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and <em>start at the beginning of the
line</em>.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

<p>
There may be an argument after the <tt>!bc</tt> tag to specify a
certain environment (for <tt>ptex2tex</tt> or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, <tt>!bc dat</tt> corresponds to
the data file environment and <tt>!bc cod</tt> is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for <tt>ptex2tex</tt> this means the <tt>ccq</tt> environment,
which is defined in the config file <tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt>,
while for Sphinx it defaults to the <tt>python</tt> environment).

<p>
Since the config file for <tt>ptex2tex</tt> can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after <tt>!bc</tt> is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Here, three arguments are defined: <tt>pycod</tt> for Python code,
<tt>cod</tt> also for Python code, <tt>cppcod</tt> for C++ code, and <tt>sys</tt>
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in <tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt> for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

<p>
By default, <tt>pro</tt> is used for complete programs in Python, <tt>cod</tt> is
for a code snippet in Python, while <tt>xcod</tt> and <tt>xpro</tt> implies computer
language specific typesetting where <tt>x</tt> can be <tt>f</tt> for Fortran, <tt>c</tt>
for C, <tt>cpp</tt> for C++, <tt>sh</tt> for Unix shells, <tt>pl</tt> for Perl, <tt>m</tt> for
Matlab, <tt>cy</tt> for Cython, and <tt>py</tt> for Python.  The argument <tt>sys</tt>
means by default <tt>console</tt> for Sphinx and <tt>CodeTerminal</tt> (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are <tt>dat</tt> for a data file
or print out, and <tt>ipy</tt> for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in <tt>sphinx</tt> output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after <tt>!bc</tt> can be redefined in the
<tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt> configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
<tt>sphinx code-blocks</tt> comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.

<p>
<!-- (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code -->
<!-- blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments -->
<!-- and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the -->
<!-- first one is used.) -->

<p>
The enclosing <tt>!ec</tt> tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

<p>
Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (<tt>pycod</tt> style):
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  pycod-->
<pre>
# regular expressions for inline tags:
inline_tag_begin = r'(?P&lt;begin&gt;(^|\s+))'
inline_tag_end = r'(?P&lt;end&gt;[.,?!;:)\s])'
INLINE_TAGS = {
    'emphasize':
    r'%s\*(?P&lt;subst&gt;[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'verbatim':
    r'%s`(?P&lt;subst&gt;[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'bold':
    r'%s_(?P&lt;subst&gt;[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
And here is a C++ code snippet (<tt>cppcod</tt> style):
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  cppcod-->
<pre>
void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
    for (int i = 1; i &lt; myarr.size(); i++) {
        myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
 @@@CODE myfile.f
 @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The first line implies that all lines in the file <tt>myfile.f</tt> are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a <tt>!bc Xpro</tt> environment, where
<tt>X</tt> is the extension of the filename, here <tt>f</tt> (i.e., the environment
becomes <tt>!bc fpro</tt> and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a <tt>fromto:</tt> directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, <tt>X</tt> is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the <tt>pro</tt> and <tt>cod</tt> arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain <tt>!bc</tt> environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
<tt>@</tt> sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching <tt>subroutine test</tt>
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching <tt>C END1</tt> (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

<p>
Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  fpro-->
<pre>
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the <tt>fromto:</tt>
directive above:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  fcod-->
<pre>
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing <tt>fromto:</tt> by
<tt>from-to</tt> ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  cod-->
<pre>
# --- Start Example 1 ---
c = -1
A = 2
p0 = 4
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 1 ---

# --- Start Example 2 ---
c = -1
A = 1
p0 = 0
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 2 ---
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
is easy with
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
With only <tt>fromto:</tt> this would be impossible.

<p>
(Remark for those familiar with <tt>ptex2tex</tt>: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in <tt>ptex2tex</tt>. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
<tt>.p.tex</tt> file to be treated by <tt>ptex2tex</tt>. However, the <tt>@@@CODE</tt> line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the <tt>ptex2tex</tt> configuration
file.)

<h3>LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text <a name="mathtext"></a>  <a name="___sec34"></a></h3>
<p>

<p>
Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is <tt>!bt</tt> (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
<tt>!et</tt>. It is important that <tt>!bt</tt> and <tt>!et</tt> appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
$$
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
$$
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Here is the result of the above <tt>!bt</tt> - <tt>!et</tt> block:
$$
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
$$

<p>
The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
<tt>latex</tt> and <tt>pdflatex</tt> has of course full support. The <tt>html</tt> format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although <tt>sphinx</tt>, like <tt>html</tt>, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
(<tt>pandoc</tt> format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the <tt>latex</tt> format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

<p>
If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After <tt>#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")</tt> one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
<tt>#else</tt> one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.

<p>

<h4>Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice  <a name="___sec35"></a></h4>
<p>
If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.

<p>

<ol>
 <li> Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.
 <li> Go to the Sphinx directory and load the <tt>conf.py</tt> file into
    a browser.
 <li> Search for "math" and comment out the
    <tt>'sphinx.ext.mathjax'</tt> (enabled by default) and
    <tt>'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'</tt> (disabled by default)
    lines, and uncomment the <tt>'sphinx.ext.pngmath'</tt> package.
    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures
    of the mathematics.
 <li> Uncomment the line with <tt>pngmath_dvipng_args =</tt> and
    set the PNG resolution to <tt>-D 200</tt> when the purpose is to
    generate mathematics pictures for slides.
 <li> Run <tt>make html</tt>.
 <li> Look at the HTML source file in the <tt>_build/html</tt>
    directory: all mathematics are in <tt>img</tt> tags with <tt>src=</tt>
    pointing to a PNG file and <tt>alt=</tt> pointing to the LaTeX
    source for the formula in question. This makes it very
    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular
    mathematical expression.
</ol>

<h3>Macros (Newcommands) <a name="newcommands"></a>  <a name="___sec36"></a></h3>
<p>

<p>
Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style <em>newcommand</em>
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
<tt>newcommand_replace.tex</tt> are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names <tt>newcommands.tex</tt> and
<tt>newcommands_keep.tex</tt> are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
<tt>!bt</tt> and <tt>!et</tt> in <tt>newcommands_keep.tex</tt> to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
<tt>newcommands_replace.tex</tt> and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the <tt>newcommands*.tex</tt> files <em>must</em> appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

<p>
<b>Example.</b> Suppose we have the following commands in
<tt>newcommand_replace.tex</tt>:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  pro-->
<pre>
\newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
\newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
\newcommand{\Q}{\pmb{Q}}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
and these in <tt>newcommands_keep.tex</tt>:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  pro-->
<pre>
\newcommand{\x}{\pmb{x}}
\newcommand{\normalvec}{\pmb{n}}
\newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The LaTeX block
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, \label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   \label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
will then be rendered to
$$
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
$$
in the current format.

<p>

<h3>Preprocessing Steps  <a name="___sec37"></a></h3>
<p>
Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess"><tt>http://code.google.com/p/preprocess</tt></a>) and mako
(<a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/"><tt>http://www.makotemplates.org/</tt></a>). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of <tt>name=value</tt> command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

<p>
Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

<p>
The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable <tt>FORMAT</tt>
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (<tt>html</tt>, <tt>latex</tt>,
<tt>plain</tt>, <tt>rst</tt>, <tt>sphinx</tt>, <tt>epydoc</tt>, <tt>st</tt>).  It is then easy to test on
the value of <tt>FORMAT</tt> and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  pro-->
<pre>
# If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
# PostScript files are used.

# #if FORMAT == "latex"
# Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
\begin{figure}
\label{fig:wavepackets}
  \begin{center}
#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
#  #endif

#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
#  #endif
  \end{center}
  \caption{
  Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
  }
\end{figure}

# #else

# Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.

# #endif
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section <a href="#doconce2formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</a>.

<p>
More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.

<p>

<p>

<p>

<h3>Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces  <a name="___sec38"></a></h3>
<p>
Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form <tt>#include "file.do.txt"</tt>.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

<p>
For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate <tt>.rst</tt> files and an index file listing the various <tt>.rst</tt>
that build up the document. To generate the various <tt>.rst</tt> files one
should not run Doconce on the individual <tt>.do.txt</tt> files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script <tt>doconce split_rst</tt>
to split the long, complete <tt>.rst</tt> into pieces. This process requires
that each <tt>#include "file.do.txt</tt> line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax <tt>#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>></tt>, where
<tt>file</tt> is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword <tt>part:</tt>.

<p>
Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is <tt>master.do.txt</tt>.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  cod-->
<pre>
doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part: name &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake_sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The autogenerated <tt>automake_sphinx.sh</tt> file (by <tt>doconce sphinx_dir</tt>)
is compatible with a master <tt>.rst</tt> file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to <tt>doconce sphinx_dir</tt>.
This set is the output of <tt>doconce split_rst</tt>, which we catch in a
variable <tt>files</tt> above.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Missing Features  <a name="___sec39"></a></h3>
<p>
Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  pro-->
<pre>
# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
# insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
# #else
# insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
# #endif
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

<p>
Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

<p>
As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
# table of contents
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce <tt>doconce format latex mydoc</tt> to produce <tt>mydoc.p.tex</tt>. Then
we use the <tt>doconce replace</tt> and <tt>doconce subst</tt> commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>doconce replace from_text to_text filename</tt> command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the <tt>replace</tt> method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with <tt>\tableofcontents</tt>, we should use <tt>doconce subst</tt>,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Note the double backshlash in front of the <tt>t</tt> character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The <tt>doconce subst</tt> is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

<p>

<h3>Header and Footer  <a name="___sec40"></a></h3>
<p>
Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if <tt>TITLE:</tt> or
<tt>#TITLE:</tt> is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Emacs Doconce Formatter  <a name="___sec41"></a></h3>
<p>
The file <tt>misc/.doconce-mode.el</tt> in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

<p>
Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

<p>
<b>Step 1.</b> Download the Doconce tarball from <tt>code.google.com/p/doconce</tt>,
pack it out and go to the root directory.

<p>
<b>Step 2.</b> Copy the <tt>doconce-mode.el</tt> file to the home directory:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
<b>Step 3.</b> Add these lines to <tt>$HOME/.emacs</tt>:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
(load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
(setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Emacs will now recognize files with extension <tt>.do.txt</tt> and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.

<p>

<p>

<h2>Troubleshooting  <a name="___sec42"></a></h2>
<p>

<h3>Disclaimer  <a name="___sec43"></a></h3>
<p>
Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running <tt>doconce format</tt>, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

<p>
However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.

<p>

<p>

<h3>General Problems  <a name="___sec44"></a></h3>
<p>

<h4>Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step  <a name="___sec45"></a></h4>
<p>
Doconce automatically removes the file <tt>__tmp.do.txt</tt>, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when <tt>mako</tt> and/or
<tt>preprocess</tt> is run). Add the <tt>--debug</tt> flag at the end of the
<tt>doconce</tt> command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
<tt>__tmp.do.txt</tt> is deleted.

<p>

<h4>Figure captions are incomplete  <a name="___sec46"></a></h4>
<p>
If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as <em>one line</em>, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

<p>

<h4>Preprocessor directives do not work  <a name="___sec47"></a></h4>
<p>
Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

<p>

<h4>Problems with boldface and emphasize  <a name="___sec48"></a></h4>
<p>
Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

<p>

<h4>Links to local directories do not work  <a name="___sec49"></a></h4>
<p>
Links of the type
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
see the "examples directory": "src/examples"
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h4>Links are not typeset correctly  <a name="___sec50"></a></h4>
<p>
Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
However, the following will not be typeset correctly:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.

<p>

<p>

<h4>Inline verbatim code is not detected  <a name="___sec51"></a></h4>
<p>
Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

<p>

<h4>Strange non-English characters  <a name="___sec52"></a></h4>
<p>
Check the encoding of the <tt>.do.txt</tt> file with the Unix <tt>file</tt> command
or with
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Unix&gt; doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Unix&gt; doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt

Unix&gt; iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<h4>Wrong Norwegian charcters  <a name="___sec53"></a></h4>
<p>
When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run <tt>doconce change_encoding</tt> to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

<p>

<h4>Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly  <a name="___sec54"></a></h4>
<p>
Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

<p>

<h4>Too short underlining of reST headlines  <a name="___sec55"></a></h4>
<p>
This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.

<p>

<p>

<h4>Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG)  <a name="___sec56"></a></h4>
<p>
This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first <tt>!bt</tt> (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

<p>

<h3>Problems with code or Tex Blocks  <a name="___sec57"></a></h3>
<p>

<h4>Code or math block errors in reST  <a name="___sec58"></a></h4>
<p>
First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

<p>
Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a <tt>!bc</tt>, which should have been removed when
running <tt>doconce format sphinx</tt>, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then <tt>!bc</tt> will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

<p>

<h4>Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST  <a name="___sec59"></a></h4>
<p>
If <tt>idx</tt> commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

<p>

<h4>Something is wrong with a verbatim code block  <a name="___sec60"></a></h4>
<p>
Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

<p>

<h4>Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format  <a name="___sec61"></a></h4>
<p>
A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before <tt>!bt</tt> and <tt>!bc</tt> environments.

<p>

<h4>Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly  <a name="___sec62"></a></h4>
<p>
Read the the section <a href="#sec:verbatim:blocks">Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code</a> above.  Start the
<tt>!bc</tt> and <tt>!ec</tt> tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

<p>

<h4>LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly  <a name="___sec63"></a></h4>
<p>
Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the <tt>!bt</tt> and <tt>!et</tt> tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.

<h3>Problems with reST/Sphinx Output  <a name="___sec64"></a></h3>
<p>

<h4>Lists do not appear in .rst files  <a name="___sec65"></a></h4>
<p>
Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

<p>

<h4>Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST  <a name="___sec66"></a></h4>
<p>
This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

<p>

<h4>Warning about duplicate link names  <a name="___sec67"></a></h4>
<p>
Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

<p>

<h4>Inconsistent headings in reST  <a name="___sec68"></a></h4>
<p>
The <tt>rst2*.py</tt> and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for <tt>===</tt>,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

<p>

<h4>No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks  <a name="___sec69"></a></h4>
<p>
The <tt>!bc ipy</tt> directive behaves this way for <tt>sphinx</tt> output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to <tt>!bc cod</tt> or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

<p>

<h3>Problems with LaTeX Output  <a name="___sec70"></a></h3>
<p>

<h4>Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed  <a name="___sec71"></a></h4>
<p>
This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the <tt>-shell-escape</tt> command-line argument when
running <tt>latex</tt> or <tt>pdflatex</tt>:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
Terminal&gt; pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Using <tt>doconce ptex2tex</tt> will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using <tt>ptex2tex</tt> requires the
preprocessor option <tt>-DMINTED</tt> to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, <tt>latex</tt> or <tt>pdflatex</tt> runs the
<tt>pygmentize</tt> program and the <tt>shell-escape</tt> option is required.

<p>

<h4>How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments?  <a name="___sec72"></a></h4>
<p>
Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via <tt>doconce replace</tt>. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
&lt;%
theorem_counter = 4
%&gt;

# begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}
&lt;%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%&gt;

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>.p.tex</tt> output file now reads
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
% begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

<p>
The next step is to replace the <tt>% begin ...</tt> and <tt>% end ...</tt> lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the <tt>.p.tex</tt> file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with <em>Theorem</em>.
The following Bash script does the job:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  shpro-->
<pre>
file=mydoc.p.tex
thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
<tt>mydoc.p.tex</tt> file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

<p>
The resulting <tt>mydoc.tex</tt> file now becomes
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
\usepackage{theorem}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]

...

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

<p>
Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the <tt>ptex2tex</tt> program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).

<p>

<p>

<h4>The LaTeX file does not compile  <a name="___sec73"></a></h4>
<p>
If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
\code{...}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

<p>

<h4>Inline verbatim gives error   <a name="___sec74"></a></h4>
<p>
Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
then replace this by
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
capture the second }
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.

<p>
<!-- Could have doconce configure file where inline verbatim is -->
<!-- configured to be \fontsize... directly, not via ptex2tex \code{}. -->

<p>

<p>

<h4>Errors in figure captions  <a name="___sec75"></a></h4>
<p>
Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

<p>
(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper <tt>texttt</tt> command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

<p>

<h4>Chapters are ignored  <a name="___sec76"></a></h4>
<p>
The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run <tt>ptex2tex</tt> with the option <tt>-DBOOK</tt> to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

<p>

<h4>I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file  <a name="___sec77"></a></h4>
<p>
The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:

<p>

<ol>
<li> Make a little Bash script that performs a series of
   <tt>doconce subst</tt> (regular expressions) or <tt>doconce replace</tt> (regular text)
   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to
   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).
<li> Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate
   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then
   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This
   means that the <tt>doconce format latex</tt> command does not generate
   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these
   files.
   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro
   text and include the various text pieces in this file.
   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files
   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the
   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but
   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.
</ol>

<h3>Problems with gwiki Output  <a name="___sec78"></a></h3>
<p>

<h4>Strange nested lists in gwiki  <a name="___sec79"></a></h4>
<p>
Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the <tt>.gwiki</tt> file directly.

<p>

<h4>Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source  <a name="___sec80"></a></h4>
<p>
Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

<p>

<h3>Problems with HTML Output  <a name="___sec81"></a></h3>
<p>

<h4>How can I change the layout of the HTML page?  <a name="___sec82"></a></h4>
<p>
The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out <tt>TITLE:</tt> to get HTML without a header and footer). The
<tt>--html-template=filename</tt> command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title (<tt>%(title)s</tt>),
a date (<tt>%(date)s</tt>), and the main body of text (<tt>%(main)s</tt>).
For typesetting code, <tt>pygments</tt> is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by <tt>--no-pygments-html</tt> (leaving code in gray boxes).

<p>

<p>
The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the <tt>sphinx</tt> format and one its many themes.

<p>
A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via <tt>doconce replace</tt> and
<tt>doconce subst</tt> in the script that generates the final documents).

<p>

<h4>Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates?  <a name="___sec83"></a></h4>
<p>
The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
doconce replace '&lt;p class="caption"&gt;' \
 '&lt;p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue"&gt;' mydoc.html
doconce replace '&lt;hr class="figure"&gt;' \
 '&lt;hr style="width: 50%"&gt;' mydoc.html
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>

<p>

<h3>Debugging  <a name="___sec84"></a></h3>
<p>
Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
<tt>_doconce_debugging.log</tt>, if the to <tt>doconce format</tt> after the filename
is <tt>debug</tt>. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.

<p>

<p>

<p>

<h2>Basic Parsing Ideas  <a name="___sec85"></a></h2>
<p>
<!-- avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea) -->

<p>
The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

<p>
All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

<p>
The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
(?P&lt;indent&gt; *(?P&lt;listtype&gt;[*o-] )? *)(?P&lt;keyword&gt;[^:]+?:)?(?P&lt;text&gt;.*)\s?
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

<p>
When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

<p>
The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

<p>
It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables  <a name="___sec86"></a></h3>
<p>
As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and <em>placed at the end of
the doc string</em>. Note that <tt>argument</tt>, <tt>keyword argument</tt>, <tt>return</tt>,
<tt>instance variable</tt>, <tt>class variable</tt>, and <tt>module variable</tt> are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
    - argument x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
    - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
    - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
    - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
    - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
      (bool variable).
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

<p>

<dl>
    <dt><b>module variable</b> x:<dd> 
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    <dt><b>module variable</b> tolerance:<dd> 
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
</dl>

\section{What Is Doconce?}

\label{what:is:doconce}
\index{doconce!short explanation}

Doconce is two things:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, {\LaTeX}, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via \code{rst2*} programs) go to XML, HTML,
    {\LaTeX}, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via \code{unoconv}) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, {\LaTeX}, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

 \item Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Here are some Doconce features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    {\LaTeX} and HTML.

  \item Doconce can be converted to plain \emph{untagged} text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  \item Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.

  \item Doconce has full support for {\LaTeX} math and integrates well
    with big {\LaTeX} projects (books).

  \item Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, {\LaTeX}, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  \item Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in {\LaTeX}, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Large books written in {\LaTeX}, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  \item Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as {\LaTeX} integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  \item Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, {\LaTeX}, Sphinx, and similar
formats.


\section{Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies}

\subsection{Doconce}

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at \href{{http://code.google.com/p/doconce}}{\nolinkurl{http://code.google.com/p/doconce}}.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (\code{hg}) source follows the standard procedure:
\bsys
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
\esys
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
\bsys
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
\esys

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
\bsys
sudo apt-get install doconce
\esys
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
\bsys
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
\esys

\subsection{Dependencies}

\paragraph{Preprocessors.}
If you make use of the \href{{http://code.google.com/p/preprocess}}{Preprocess}
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

\bsys
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
\esys

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
\href{{http://www.makotemplates.org}}{Mako}. Its installation is most
conveniently done by \code{pip},

\bsys
pip install Mako
\esys
This command requires \code{pip} to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

\bsys
sudo apt-get install python-pip
\esys
Alternatively, one can install from the \code{pip} \href{{http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip}}{source code}.

\paragraph{Ptex2tex for {\LaTeX} Output.}
To make {\LaTeX} documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need \href{{http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex}}{ptex2tex},
which is installed by

\bsys
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
\esys
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, \code{cp2texmf.sh}:

\bsys
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
\esys
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that \code{ptex2tex} potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

\bsys
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
\esys
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the \code{~/texmf/tex/latex/misc} directory).

Note that the \code{doconce ptex2tex} command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the \code{ptex2tex}
program.

The \emph{minted} {\LaTeX} style is offered by \code{ptex2tex} and \code{doconce ptext2tex}
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package \href{{http://pygments.org}}{Pygments}
to be installed:
\bsys
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
\esys

If you use the minted style together with \code{ptex2tex}, you have to
enable it by the \code{-DMINTED} command-line argument to \code{ptex2tex}.  All
use of the minted style requires the \code{-shell-escape} command-line
argument when running {\LaTeX}, i.e., \code{latex -shell-escape} or \code{pdflatex
-shell-escape}.

% Say something about anslistings.sty

\paragraph{reStructuredText (reST) Output.}
The \code{rst} output from Doconce allows further transformation to {\LaTeX},
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the \href{{http://docutils.sourceforge.net}}{docutils} package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

\bsys
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
\esys
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
\bsys
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
\esys

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of {\LaTeX}. The enabling software is
\href{{http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf}}{rst2pdf}. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the \code{rst2pdf} directory and
run the usual \code{sudo python setup.py install}.


Output to \code{sphinx} requires of course \href{{http://sphinx.pocoo.org}}{Sphinx},
installed by
\bsys
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
\esys

\paragraph{Markdown and Pandoc Output.}
The Doconce format \code{pandoc} outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the \code{pandoc} program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of \href{{http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/}}{Pandoc}, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

\bsys
sudo apt-get install pandoc
\esys

\paragraph{Epydoc Output.}
When the output format is \code{epydoc} one needs that program too, installed
by
\bsys
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
\esys

\paragraph{Remark.}
Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
\code{apt-get install} command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For \code{svn} directories, go to the directory,
run \code{svn update}, and then \code{sudo python setup.py install}. For
Mercurial (\code{hg}) directories, go to the directory, run
\code{hg pull; hg update}, and then \code{sudo python setup.py install}.


% 
% Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting
% these lines are converted to comments in the output format.
% This may have some side effects, especially in rst and sphinx
% where lines following the comment may be taken as part of
% the comment if there are no blank lines after the comment.
% 
% One can use ## and the mako preprocessor to remove comments
% \emph{before} doconce sees the text. That can be useful when
% doconce comments interferes with formatting.
% The mako tool also supports <%doc> .. </%doc>
% 

\subsection{Demos}

\index{demos}

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the
\bsys
docs/manual/manual.do.txt
\esys
file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
\href{{https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html}}{demo web page}
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, {\LaTeX}, plain text, etc.

The file \code{make.sh} in the same directory as the \code{manual.do.txt} file
(the current text) shows how to run \code{doconce format} on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in
\bsys
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
\esys
In the \code{tutorial} directory there is also a \code{make.sh} file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
\href{{https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html}}{web demo}
of the results.

% Example on including another Doconce file:


\section{From Doconce to Other Formats}

\label{doconce2formats}

Transformation of a Doconce document \code{mydoc.do.txt} to various other
formats applies the script \code{doconce format}:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
\esys
or just
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
\esys
The \code{mako} or \code{preprocess} programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to \code{mako} or \code{preprocess} can be added after the
filename. For example,
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
\esys
The variable \code{FORMAT} is always defined as the current format when
running \code{preprocess}. That is, in the last example, \code{FORMAT} is
defined as \code{latex}. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like \code{#if FORMAT == "latex"}.

The command-line arguments \code{--no-preprocess} and \code{--no-mako} turn off
running \code{preprocess} and \code{mako}, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
\esys
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
\bccq
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
\eccq
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

\subsection{HTML}

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file \code{mydoc.do.txt}
is performed by
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
\esys
The resulting file \code{mydoc.html} can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the \code{pygmentize} program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument \code{--no-pygments-html}
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain \code{<pre>} HTML tags. The option \code{--pygments-html-linenos} turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": \code{%(title)s} for a title,
\code{%(date)s} for a date, and \code{%(main)s} for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
\code{DATE:} line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert \code{%(title)s} and
\code{%(date)s} at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by \code{%(main)s}. Here is an example:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
\esys

\subsection{Pandoc and Markdown}

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
\esys
The name of the output file is \code{mydoc.mkd}.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
\bsys
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
\esys
Pandoc supports \code{latex}, \code{html}, \code{odt} (OpenOffice), \code{docx} (Microsoft
Word), \code{rtf}, \code{texinfo}, to mention some. The \code{-R} option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or {\LaTeX} to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the \code{--toc} option generates a table of contents.
See the \href{{http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html}}{Pandoc documentation}
for the many features of the \code{pandoc} program.

Pandoc is useful to go from {\LaTeX} mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
\code{doconce format pandoc} and then translating using \code{pandoc}, or
\code{doconce format latex}, and then going from {\LaTeX} to the desired format
using \code{pandoc}.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
\esys
When we go through \code{pandoc}, only single equations or \code{align*}
environments are well understood.

Quite some \code{doconce replace} and \code{doconce subst} edits might be needed
on the \code{.mkd} or \code{.tex} files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via {\LaTeX}.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
\esys
The \code{-s} option adds a proper header and footer to the \code{mydoc.html} file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

\subsection{{\LaTeX}}

Making a {\LaTeX} file \code{mydoc.tex} from \code{mydoc.do.txt} is done in two steps:
% Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many
% formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph
% environment, as used here.

\paragraph{Step 1.}
Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form \code{mydoc.p.tex} for
the \code{ptex2tex} program (or \code{doconce ptex2tex}):
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
\esys
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files \code{newcommands.tex}, \code{newcommands_keep.tex}, or
\code{newcommands_replace.tex} (see Section~\ref{newcommands}).
If these files are present, they are included in the {\LaTeX} document
so that your commands are defined.

\paragraph{Step 2.}
Run \code{ptex2tex} (if you have it) to make a standard {\LaTeX} file,
\bsys
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
\esys
In case you do not have \code{ptex2tex}, you may run a (very) simplified version:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
\esys

Note that Doconce generates a \code{.p.tex} file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the {\LaTeX} document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
\bsys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
\esys
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard {\LaTeX} "maketitle" heading
is also available through \code{-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional}.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
\code{-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage}.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

\begin{itemize}
 \item \code{BOOK} for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)

 \item \code{PALATINO} for the Palatino font

 \item \code{HELVETIA} for the Helvetica font

 \item \code{A4PAPER} for A4 paper size

 \item \code{A6PAPER} for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)

 \item \code{MOVIE15} for using the movie15 {\LaTeX} package to display movies

 \item \code{PREAMBLE} to turn the {\LaTeX} preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)

 \item \code{MINTED} for inclusion of the minted package (which requires \code{latex}
   or \code{pdflatex} to be run with the \code{-shell-escape} option)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The \code{ptex2tex} tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in {\LaTeX}
documents. After any \code{!bc} command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your \code{.ptex2tex.cfg}
file, e.g., \code{!bc sys} for a terminal session, where \code{sys} is set to
a certain environment in \code{.ptex2tex.cfg} (e.g., \code{CodeTerminal}).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the \code{doconce ptex2tex} command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the \code{.p.tex} file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
\esys
Note that \code{@} must be used to separate the begin and end {\LaTeX}
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as \code{minted}
above, which implies \code{\begin{minted}{fortran}} and \code{\end{minted}} as
begin and end for blocks inside \code{!bc fpro} and \code{!ec}).  Specifying
\code{envir=ans:nt} means that all other environments are typeset with the
\code{anslistings.sty} package, e.g., \code{!bc cppcod} will then result in
\code{\begin{c++}}. If no environments like \code{sys}, \code{fpro}, or the common
\code{envir} are defined on the command line, the plain \code{\begin{verbatim}}
and \code{\end{verbatim}} used.


\paragraph{Step 2b (optional).}
Edit the \code{mydoc.tex} file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute \code{section} by \code{section*} to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the \code{doconce replace} and \code{doconce subst}
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
\esys
A lot of tailored fixes to the {\LaTeX} document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the {\LaTeX} file.

\paragraph{Step 3.}
Compile \code{mydoc.tex}
and create the PDF file:
\bsys
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
\esys

If one wishes to run \code{ptex2tex} and use the minted {\LaTeX} package for
typesetting code blocks (\code{Minted_Python}, \code{Minted_Cpp}, etc., in
\code{ptex2tex} specified through the \code{*pro} and \code{*cod} variables in
\code{.ptex2tex.cfg} or \code{$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg}), the minted {\LaTeX} package is
needed.  This package is included by running \code{ptex2tex} with the
\code{-DMINTED} option:
\bsys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
\esys
In this case, \code{latex} must be run with the
\code{-shell-escape} option:
\bsys
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
\esys
When running \code{doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted} (or other minted
specifications with \code{doconce ptex2tex}), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the \code{-DMINTED} option.

\subsection{PDFLaTeX}

Running \code{pdflatex} instead of \code{latex} follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
\esys
Then \code{ptex2tex} is run as explained above, and finally
\bsys
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
\esys

\subsection{Plain ASCII Text}

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
\esys

\subsection{reStructuredText}

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file \code{mydoc.rst}:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
\esys
We may now produce various other formats:
\bsys
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
\esys

The OpenOffice file \code{mydoc.odt} can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program \code{unovonv}
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports \emph{on the command line}.
Run
\bsys
Terminal> unoconv --show
\esys
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
\code{mydoc.odt} to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
\bsys
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
\esys

\paragraph{Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.}
At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and {\LaTeX} mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by \code{latex} as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the \code{sphinx} output format.
Some links for going from {\LaTeX} to Word are listed below.

\end{itemize}

\noindent

\subsection{Sphinx}

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the \code{doconce sphinx_dir} command:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
\esys
The keywords \code{author}, \code{title}, and \code{version} are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, \code{version} is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files \code{file1},
\code{file2}, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files \code{file1}, \code{file2}, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of \code{dirname} is \code{sphinx-rootdir}. The \code{theme}
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is \code{'default'}).

With a single-file document in \code{mydoc.do.txt} one often just runs
\bsys
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
\esys
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory \code{sphinx-rootdir} is made with
relevant files.

The \code{doconce sphinx_dir} command generates a script
\code{automake_sphinx.py} for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run \code{automake_sphinx.py} or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The \code{doconce sphinx_dir} script copies directories named \code{figs} or
\code{figures} over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, \code{automake_sphinx.py} must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not \code{http:} or \code{file:} URLs), must be
placed in the \code{_static} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility \code{doconce sphinxfix_localURLs} is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say \code{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt} it
replaces the link by \code{_static/myfile.txt} and copies
\code{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt} to a local \code{_static} directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in \code{_static} or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all \code{_static/*} files to the
\code{_static} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a \code{_static} or \code{_static-name} directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the \code{conf.py}
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
\code{make-themes.sh} can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes \code{fenics} and \code{pyramid}, one writes
\bsys
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
\esys
The resulting directories with HTML documents are \code{_build/html_fenics}
and \code{_build/html_pyramid}, respectively. Without arguments,
\code{make-themes.sh} makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file \code{mydoc.do.txt}.

\paragraph{Step 1.}
Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
\esys

\paragraph{Step 2.}
Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive \code{sphinx-quickstart}
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
\bsys
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
\esys
The autogenerated \code{conf.py} file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The \code{doconce sphinx_dir} generator makes an extended \code{conv.py}
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


\paragraph{Step 3.}
Copy the \code{mydoc.rst} file to the Sphinx root directory:
\bsys
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
\esys
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with \code{mydoc.rst} in the \code{sphinx-rootdir}
directory. Either edit \code{mydoc.rst} so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to \code{sphinx-rootdir}.
Links to local files in \code{mydoc.rst} must be modified to links to
files in the \code{_static} directory, see comment above.

\paragraph{Step 4.}
Edit the generated \code{index.rst} file so that \code{mydoc.rst}
is included, i.e., add \code{mydoc} to the \code{toctree} section so that it becomes
\bccq
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
\eccq
(The spaces before \code{mydoc} are important!)

\paragraph{Step 5.}
Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
\bsys
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
\esys

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with \code{index.html} files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, {\LaTeX}, PDF (via {\LaTeX}), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

\paragraph{Step 6.}
View the result:
\bsys
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
\esys

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows \code{!bc}: \code{cod} gives Python
(\code{code-block:: python} in Sphinx syntax) and \code{cppcod} gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and {\LaTeX} output.

\subsection{Wiki Formats}

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
\href{{http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax}}{Googlecode wiki}, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
\code{gwiki}, \code{mwiki}, and \code{cwiki}, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
\bsys
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
\esys

The Googlecode wiki document, \code{mydoc.gwiki}, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the \code{.gwiki} file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of \href{{http://pediapress.com/code/}}{mwlib}. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write \href{{http://en.wikibooks.org}}{Wikibooks}
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard {\LaTeX} book or a Sphinx web document.

\subsection{Tweaking the Doconce Output}

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
\code{.rst} file is going to be filtered to {\LaTeX} or HTML, it cannot know
if \code{.eps} or \code{.png} is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The \code{make.sh} files in \code{docs/manual} and \code{docs/tutorial}
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


\section{The Doconce Markup Language}

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

\subsection{Lists}

An unordered bullet list makes use of the \code{*} as bullet sign
and is indented as follows

\bccq
   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3
\eccq

This list gets typeset as

\begin{itemize}
   \item item 1

   \item item 2
\begin{itemize}

     \item subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     \item subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

\end{itemize}

\noindent
   \item item 3
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In an ordered list, each item starts with an \code{o} (as the first letter
in "ordered"):

\bccq
   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3
\eccq

resulting in

\begin{enumerate}
  \item item 1

  \item item 2
\begin{itemize}

     \item subitem 1

     \item subitem 2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
  \item item 3
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:

\bccq
   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)
\eccq

The result becomes

\begin{description}
   \item[keyword1:] 
     explanation of keyword1

   \item[keyword2:] 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)
\end{description}

\noindent

\subsection{Special Lines}

The Doconce markup language has a concept called \emph{special lines}.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.

\index{TITLE@{\rm\texttt{TITLE}} keyword} \index{AUTHOR@{\rm\texttt{AUTHOR}} keyword} \index{DATE@{\rm\texttt{DATE}} keyword}

\paragraph{Heading with Title and Author(s).}
Lines starting with \code{TITLE:}, \code{AUTHOR:}, and \code{DATE:} are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax
\bccq
name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3
\eccq
The \code{at} with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the \code{and} with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax
\bccq
name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2
\eccq
Multiple authors require multiple \code{AUTHOR:} lines. All information
associated with \code{TITLE:} and \code{AUTHOR:} keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:
\bccq
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: November 9, 2016
\eccq
Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including \code{rst} and \code{sphinx})
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:
\bccq
Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
A. Dummy Author

[1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
[2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
[3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
\eccq
Similar typesetting is done for {\LaTeX} and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as \code{today}.

\index{TOC@{\rm\texttt{TOC}} keyword}

\paragraph{Table of Contents.}
A table of contents can be generated by the line
\bccq
TOC: on
\eccq
This line is usually placed after the \code{DATE:} line.
A value \code{off} turns off the table of contents.

\index{headlines} \index{section headings}

\paragraph{Section Headings.}
Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

\begin{itemize}
   \item 9 \code{=} characters for chapters

   \item 7 for sections

   \item 5 for subsections

   \item 3 for subsubsections

   \item 2 \emph{underscrores} (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
\emph{must} be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples:
\bccq
__Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
various section headings.

========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========

Some text.


======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.


===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====

The running text goes here.

===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.
\eccq


\section{Special Lines}

\subsection{Figures}

% Note: need extra blank after FIGURE and MOVIE in !bc environments
% because doconce treats !ec as part of the caption and moves the
% !ec up to the caption line

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax
\bccq
FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

\eccq
The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say \code{.eps} when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's \code{convert} utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for \code{TITLE:} and \code{AUTHOR:} lines, all information
related to a figure line \emph{must be written on the same line}. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as \code{FIGURE:} will be
included in the formatted caption).


\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figs/streamtubes.eps}}
  \caption{
  Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. \label{fig:viz}
  }
\end{figure}
%\clearpage % flush figures fig:viz


Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
\code{montage} program from the ImageMagick suite:
\bsys
montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
        file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png
\esys
The option \code{-tile XxY} gives \code{X} figures in the horizontal direction and
\code{Y} in the vertical direction (\code{tile 2x} means two figures per row
and \code{-tile x2} means two rows).

\subsection{Movies}

Here is an example on the \code{MOVIE:} keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the \code{latex}, \code{html}, \code{rst}, and \code{sphinx} formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.
\bccq
MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption

\eccq

% latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies,
% or just plain \href{run: ...}{...}


\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}

% #ifdef MOVIE15
\includemovie[poster,
label=figs/mjolnir.mpeg,
autoplay,
%controls,
%toolbar,
% #ifdef EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER
externalviewer,
% #endif
text={\small (Loading figs/mjolnir.mpeg)},
repeat,
]{0.9\linewidth}{0.9\linewidth}{figs/mjolnir.mpeg}    % requires \usepackage{movie15}
% #ifndef EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER
\movieref[rate=0.5]{figs/mjolnir.mpeg}{Slower}
\movieref[rate=2]{figs/mjolnir.mpeg}{Faster}
\movieref[default]{figs/mjolnir.mpeg}{Normal}
\movieref[pause]{figs/mjolnir.mpeg}{Play/Pause}
\movieref[stop]{figs/mjolnir.mpeg}{Stop}
% #else
\href{run:figs/mjolnir.mpeg}{figs/mjolnir.mpeg}
% #endif

% #else
\href{run:figs/mjolnir.mpeg}{figs/mjolnir.mpeg}

% alternative: \movie command that comes with beamer
% \movie[options]{figs/mjolnir.mpeg}{figs/mjolnir.mpeg}
% #endif
\end{center}
\caption{}
\end{figure}


% MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470]

% MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470]

The {\LaTeX} format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via {\LaTeX} and
the \code{movie15} package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable \code{MOVIE15}. There is an associated variable
\code{EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER} which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):
\bsys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc
\esys

The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
\code{myframes*.png}. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the \code{MOVIE:} command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).

\subsection{Copying Computer Code from Source Files}

Another type of special lines starts with \code{@@@CODE} and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
Section~\ref{sec:verbatim:blocks} below.

\subsection{Inline Tagging}

\label{inline:tagging}
\index{inline tagging} \index{emphasized words} \index{boldface words} \index{verbatim text}
\index{inline comments}

Doconce supports tags for \emph{emphasized phrases}, \textbf{boldface phrases},
and \code{verbatim text} (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus {\LaTeX}/TeX inline mathematics, such as $\nu = \sin(x)$.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in
\bccq
*emphasized words*
\eccq

Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:
\bccq
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.
\eccq
The line above gets typeset as
\textbf{several words in boldface} followed by \emph{ephasized text}.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks:
\bccq
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.
\eccq
The typesetting result looks like this:
\code{call myroutine(a, b)} looks like a Fortran call
while \code{void myfunc(double *a, double *b)} must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats ({\LaTeX} and \code{ptex2tex}) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as
\bccq
some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
\eccq
which appears as some URL like \href{{http://google.com}}{Search Google}.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in \code{.txt}, \code{.html}, \code{.pdf}, \code{.py}, \code{.f},
\code{.f77}, \code{.f90}, \code{.f95}, \code{.sh}, \code{.csh}, \code{.ksh}, \code{.zsh},
\code{.c}, \code{.cpp}, \code{.cxx}, \code{.pl}, and \code{.java} follows the same
setup:
\bccq
see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".
\eccq
which appears as see the \href{{manual.do.txt}}{Doconce Manual}.
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:

\begin{itemize}
  \item In the \code{html} format the links work well if the files are
    supplied with the \code{.html} with the same relative location.

  \item In the \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex} formats, such links in PDF files
    will unless the \code{.tex} file has a full URL specified through
    a \code{\hyperbaseurl} command and the linked files are located correctly
    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.

  \item In the \code{sphinx} format, local files to which there are links should only be
    located in a \code{_static} or \code{_static-name} subdirectory.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a \code{_static} or \code{_static-name} directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (\code{name} is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the \code{html} format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
\code{pygmentize}, e.g.,
\bsys
Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
          -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh
\esys
Then you can link to \code{_static/make.sh.html} instead of
\code{subdir/make.sh}. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as \code{src/myprog.py} in her
software and the document links to \code{_static/myprog.py}:
\bccq
See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").
\eccq

Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
\emph{the filename as link text}. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:
\bccq
URL: "manual.html"
\eccq
resulting in the link \href{{manual.html}}{\nolinkurl{manual.html}}.

% This is now automatically carried out by the autogenerated
% script for sphinx:
% For such local links to
% work with the \code{sphinx} format, the \code{.rst} file needs a fix, carried
% out by
% !bc sys
% doconce sphinxfix_localURLs mydoc.rst
% !ec
% (The files, such as \code{manual.html}, are then copied to a subdirectory
% \code{_static}, which must be manually copied to the Sphinx directory's
% \code{_static} directory - links in the \code{.rst} files are automatically
% adjusted.)

Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:
\bccq
Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".
\eccq
resulting in Click on this link: \href{{http://code.google.com/p/doconce}}{\nolinkurl{http://code.google.com/p/doconce}}.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:
\bccq
[name: comment]
\eccq
where \code{name} is the name of the author of the command, and \code{comment} is a
plain text text. \inlinecomment{hpl}{Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.}
The name and comment are visible in the output unless \code{doconce format}
is run with a command-line argument \code{--skip_inline_comments}
(see Chapter~\ref{doconce2formats} for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the \code{.do.txt} file
(see Chapter~\ref{doconce2formats}).

Inline mathematics is written as in {\LaTeX}, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in {\LaTeX}, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in {\LaTeX} syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII:

\bccq
Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.
\eccq
That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with {\LaTeX} support (\code{latex}, \code{pdflatex}, \code{html},
\code{sphinx}, \code{mwiki}), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$, where $\bf A$
is an $n\times n$ matrix, and $\bf x$ and $\bf b$
are vectors of length $n$."

\subsection{Comments}

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as \emph{inline comments} in Doconce and described
in Section~\ref{inline:tagging}.

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash \code{#}:
\bccq
#
# Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
# These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
#
\eccq
Such comment lines may have some side effects in the \code{rst} and \code{sphinx}
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out \emph{before}
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash \code{##} and lines enclosed by
the \code{<%doc>} (beginning) and \code{<%doc/>} (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.

\subsection{Cross-Referencing}

\index{cross referencing} \index{labels} \index{references}

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:
\bccq
label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.
\eccq
This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
{\LaTeX}. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
\code{rst} and \code{sphinx} formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by \code{doconce format}. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with {\LaTeX} "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in {\LaTeX}.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure~\ref{fig:viz}
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to Sections~\ref{mathtext} and~\ref{newcommands} are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say (\ref{my:eq1})--(\ref{my:eq2}). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in Section~\ref{inline:tagging}.

\subsection{Index and Bibliography}

\index{index} \index{citations} \index{bibliography}

An index can be created for the \code{latex}, \code{rst}, and \code{sphinx} formats
by the \code{idx} keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:
\bccq
idx{some index entry}
idx{main entry!subentry}
idx{`verbatim_text` and more}
\eccq
The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a {\LaTeX} setting to
\bccq
\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}
\eccq
Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: \code{idx}
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
{\LaTeX} is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:
\bccq
as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.
\eccq
Citation labels can be separated by comma. In {\LaTeX}, this is directly
translated to the corresponding \code{cite} command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like
\bccq
as found in [3][14]
\eccq
if \code{Larsen_1986} has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and \code{Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999} is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword \code{BIBFILE:},
followed by a BibTeX file with extension \code{.bib},
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension \code{.rst},
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension \code{.py}.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,
\bccq
{
'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
""",
'Larsen_1986':
"""
O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
*Personal Press*. 1986.
"""
}
\eccq

In the \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex} formats, the \code{.bib} file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the \code{rst} and \code{sphinx} formats, the
\code{.rst} file will be copied into the document at the place where the
\code{BIBFILE:} keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the \code{BIBFILE:} line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is \code{myfile.bib}.
Insert \code{BIBFILE: myfile.bib} at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a {\LaTeX} document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the \code{.rst} file, either by manual editing
of \code{myfile.bbl} or using \code{doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl} to automate (most of)
this editing. From the \code{myfile.rst} file it is easy to create \code{myfile.py}
with the dictionary version of the references.

\subsection{Tables}

A table like


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{rrr}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:
\bccq
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
\eccq
The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters \code{c}, \code{r}, or \code{l} to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes \code{|} can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in {\LaTeX} tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (\code{rst} and \code{sphinx} are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.

\subsection{Exercises, Problems, or Projects}

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
\emph{exercise}, \emph{problem}, or \emph{project}.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 \code{=} characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this:
\bccq
===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{proj:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf
solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt

Here goes the running text of the project....

\eccq
Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project \emph{title},
the \emph{label}, the \emph{result file}, the \emph{solution} (if any of
these three entities is present), and the \emph{running text}. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with \code{!bsubex} and ending
with \code{!esubex}, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) \emph{answer}, and \emph{hints}. The environments have begin-end
directives \code{!bans}, \code{!eans}, \code{!bsol}, \code{!esol}, \code{!bhint}, \code{!ehint}, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
\code{!bc} and \code{!ec}).

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the \code{solution=...} directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows:
\bccq
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf

Here goes the running text of the project....

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
\eccq

The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file \code{.mydoc.exerinfo},
if \code{mydoc.do.txt} is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in {\LaTeX}, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The \emph{title} is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem~\ref{...}"
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".

\subsection{Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code}

\label{sec:verbatim:blocks}

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" \code{!bc} keyword and an "end code" \code{!ec} keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and \emph{start at the beginning of the
line}.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the \code{!bc} tag to specify a
certain environment (for \code{ptex2tex} or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, \code{!bc dat} corresponds to
the data file environment and \code{!bc cod} is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for \code{ptex2tex} this means the \code{ccq} environment,
which is defined in the config file \code{.ptex2tex.cfg},
while for Sphinx it defaults to the \code{python} environment).

Since the config file for \code{ptex2tex} can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after \code{!bc} is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.,
\bccq
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
\eccq
Here, three arguments are defined: \code{pycod} for Python code,
\code{cod} also for Python code, \code{cppcod} for C++ code, and \code{sys}
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in \code{.ptex2tex.cfg} for how to typeset the blocks in {\LaTeX} using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a {\LaTeX}
context).

By default, \code{pro} is used for complete programs in Python, \code{cod} is
for a code snippet in Python, while \code{xcod} and \code{xpro} implies computer
language specific typesetting where \code{x} can be \code{f} for Fortran, \code{c}
for C, \code{cpp} for C++, \code{sh} for Unix shells, \code{pl} for Perl, \code{m} for
Matlab, \code{cy} for Cython, and \code{py} for Python.  The argument \code{sys}
means by default \code{console} for Sphinx and \code{CodeTerminal} (ptex2tex
environent) for {\LaTeX}. Other specifications are \code{dat} for a data file
or print out, and \code{ipy} for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in \code{sphinx} output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after \code{!bc} can be redefined in the
\code{.ptex2tex.cfg} configuration file for ptex2tex/{\LaTeX} and in the
\code{sphinx code-blocks} comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.

% (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code
% blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments
% and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the
% first one is used.)

The enclosing \code{!ec} tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (\code{pycod} style):
\bpycod
# regular expressions for inline tags:
inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
INLINE_TAGS = {
    'emphasize':
    r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'verbatim':
    r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'bold':
    r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
}
\epycod
And here is a C++ code snippet (\code{cppcod} style):
\bcppcod
void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
        myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
    }
}
\ecppcod

% When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise
% ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then
\bccq
 @@@CODE myfile.f
 @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1
\eccq
The first line implies that all lines in the file \code{myfile.f} are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a \code{!bc Xpro} environment, where
\code{X} is the extension of the filename, here \code{f} (i.e., the environment
becomes \code{!bc fpro} and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a \code{fromto:} directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, \code{X} is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the \code{pro} and \code{cod} arguments are only used for {\LaTeX}
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain \code{!bc} environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
\code{@} sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching \code{subroutine test}
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching \code{C END1} (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):

\bfpro
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
\efpro

Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the \code{fromto:}
directive above:

\bfcod
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
\efcod

Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing \code{fromto:} by
\code{from-to} ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text
\bcod
# --- Start Example 1 ---
c = -1
A = 2
p0 = 4
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 1 ---

# --- Start Example 2 ---
c = -1
A = 1
p0 = 0
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 2 ---
\ecod
is easy with
\bccq
from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2
\eccq
With only \code{fromto:} this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with \code{ptex2tex}: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in \code{ptex2tex}. When
transforming Doconce to {\LaTeX}, one first transforms the document to a
\code{.p.tex} file to be treated by \code{ptex2tex}. However, the \code{@@@CODE} line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the \code{ptex2tex} configuration
file.)

\subsection{{\LaTeX} Blocks of Mathematical Text}

\label{mathtext}

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is \code{!bt} (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
\code{!et}. It is important that \code{!bt} and \code{!et} appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.
\bccq
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
\eccq
Here is the result of the above \code{!bt} - \code{!et} block:
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}

The support of {\LaTeX} mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
\code{latex} and \code{pdflatex} has of course full support. The \code{html} format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although \code{sphinx}, like \code{html}, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
(\code{pandoc} format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the \code{latex} format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from {\LaTeX} to MS Word (note that only a subset of {\LaTeX} will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of {\LaTeX}
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After \code{#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")} one places {\LaTeX} mathematics, and after
\code{#else} one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.

\paragraph{Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice.}
If you have {\LaTeX} mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.

 \item Go to the Sphinx directory and load the \code{conf.py} file into
    a browser.

 \item Search for "math" and comment out the
    \code{'sphinx.ext.mathjax'} (enabled by default) and
    \code{'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'} (disabled by default)
    lines, and uncomment the \code{'sphinx.ext.pngmath'} package.
    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures
    of the mathematics.

 \item Uncomment the line with \code{pngmath_dvipng_args =} and
    set the PNG resolution to \code{-D 200} when the purpose is to
    generate mathematics pictures for slides.

 \item Run \code{make html}.

 \item Look at the HTML source file in the \code{_build/html}
    directory: all mathematics are in \code{img} tags with \code{src=}
    pointing to a PNG file and \code{alt=} pointing to the {\LaTeX}
    source for the formula in question. This makes it very
    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular
    mathematical expression.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent

\subsection{Macros (Newcommands)}

\label{newcommands}

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style \emph{newcommand}
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
\code{newcommand_replace.tex} are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for {\LaTeX} (since {\LaTeX} performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names \code{newcommands.tex} and
\code{newcommands_keep.tex} are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands {\LaTeX} math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
\code{!bt} and \code{!et} in \code{newcommands_keep.tex} to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw {\LaTeX} math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render {\LaTeX}.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
\code{newcommands_replace.tex} and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the \code{newcommands*.tex} files \emph{must} appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

\paragraph{Example.}
Suppose we have the following commands in
\code{newcommand_replace.tex}:

\bpro
\newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
\newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
\newcommand{\Q}{\pmb{Q}}
\epro

and these in \code{newcommands_keep.tex}:

\bpro
\newcommand{\x}{\pmb{x}}
\newcommand{\normalvec}{\pmb{n}}
\newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}
\epro

The {\LaTeX} block
\bccq
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
\eccq
will then be rendered to
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
in the current format.

\subsection{Preprocessing Steps}

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(\href{{http://code.google.com/p/preprocess}}{\nolinkurl{http://code.google.com/p/preprocess}}) and mako
(\href{{http://www.makotemplates.org/}}{\nolinkurl{http://www.makotemplates.org/}}). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of \code{name=value} command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable \code{FORMAT}
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (\code{html}, \code{latex},
\code{plain}, \code{rst}, \code{sphinx}, \code{epydoc}, \code{st}).  It is then easy to test on
the value of \code{FORMAT} and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special {\LaTeX} output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example:

\bpro
# If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
# PostScript files are used.

# #if FORMAT == "latex"
# Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
\begin{figure}
label{fig:wavepackets}
  \begin{center}
#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
#  #endif

#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
#  #endif
  \end{center}
  \caption{
  Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
  }
\end{figure}

# #else

# Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.

# #endif
\epro

Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in Section~\ref{doconce2formats}.

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.

\subsection{Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces}

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form \code{#include "file.do.txt"}.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate \code{.rst} files and an index file listing the various \code{.rst}
that build up the document. To generate the various \code{.rst} files one
should not run Doconce on the individual \code{.do.txt} files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script \code{doconce split_rst}
to split the long, complete \code{.rst} into pieces. This process requires
that each \code{#include "file.do.txt} line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax \code{#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>}, where
\code{file} is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword \code{part:}.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is \code{master.do.txt}.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run
\bcod
doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake_sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi
\ecod
The autogenerated \code{automake_sphinx.sh} file (by \code{doconce sphinx_dir})
is compatible with a master \code{.rst} file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to \code{doconce sphinx_dir}.
This set is the output of \code{doconce split_rst}, which we catch in a
variable \code{files} above.

\subsection{Missing Features}

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in {\LaTeX} output, do something line

\bpro
# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
# insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
# #else
# insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
# #endif
\epro

Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in {\LaTeX}, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really {\LaTeX} dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the {\LaTeX} output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say
\bccq
# table of contents
\eccq
we can use this comment to edit the {\LaTeX} file. First, we run
Doconce \code{doconce format latex mydoc} to produce \code{mydoc.p.tex}. Then
we use the \code{doconce replace} and \code{doconce subst} commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:
\bccq
Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
\eccq
The \code{doconce replace from_text to_text filename} command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the \code{replace} method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with \code{\tableofcontents}, we should use \code{doconce subst},
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:
\bccq
Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
\eccq
Note the double backshlash in front of the \code{t} character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The \code{doconce subst} is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a {\LaTeX} document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant {\LaTeX} constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

\subsection{Header and Footer}

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. {\LaTeX} and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a {\LaTeX} context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if \code{TITLE:} or
\code{#TITLE:} is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.

\subsection{Emacs Doconce Formatter}

The file \code{misc/.doconce-mode.el} in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

\paragraph{Step 1.}
Download the Doconce tarball from \code{code.google.com/p/doconce},
pack it out and go to the root directory.

\paragraph{Step 2.}
Copy the \code{doconce-mode.el} file to the home directory:
\bccq
cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME
\eccq

\paragraph{Step 3.}
Add these lines to \code{$HOME/.emacs}:
\bccq
(load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
(setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))
\eccq
Emacs will now recognize files with extension \code{.do.txt} and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.


\section{Troubleshooting}

\subsection{Disclaimer}

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running \code{doconce format}, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.

\subsection{General Problems}

\paragraph{Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step.}
Doconce automatically removes the file \code{__tmp.do.txt}, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when \code{mako} and/or
\code{preprocess} is run). Add the \code{--debug} flag at the end of the
\code{doconce} command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
\code{__tmp.do.txt} is deleted.

\paragraph{Figure captions are incomplete.}
If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as \emph{one line}, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

\paragraph{Preprocessor directives do not work.}
Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

\paragraph{Problems with boldface and emphasize.}
Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

\paragraph{Links to local directories do not work.}
Links of the type
\bccq
see the "examples directory": "src/examples"
\eccq
do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file:
\bccq
see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"
\eccq

\paragraph{Links are not typeset correctly.}
Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim:
\bccq
see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".
\eccq
However, the following will not be typeset correctly:
\bccq
see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"
\eccq
The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.

\paragraph{Inline verbatim code is not detected.}
Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

\paragraph{Strange non-English characters.}
Check the encoding of the \code{.do.txt} file with the Unix \code{file} command
or with
\bccq
Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
\eccq
If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands
\bccq
Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt

Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
\eccq

\paragraph{Wrong Norwegian charcters.}
When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run \code{doconce change_encoding} to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

\paragraph{Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly.}
Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

\paragraph{Too short underlining of reST headlines.}
This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.

\paragraph{Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG).}
This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first \code{!bt} (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

\subsection{Problems with code or Tex Blocks}

\paragraph{Code or math block errors in reST.}
First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a \code{!bc}, which should have been removed when
running \code{doconce format sphinx}, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then \code{!bc} will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

\paragraph{Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST.}
If \code{idx} commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

\paragraph{Something is wrong with a verbatim code block.}
Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

\paragraph{Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format.}
A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before \code{!bt} and \code{!bc} environments.

\paragraph{Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly.}
Read the Section~\ref{sec:verbatim:blocks} above.  Start the
\code{!bc} and \code{!ec} tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

\paragraph{{\LaTeX} code blocks inside lists look ugly.}
Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the \code{!bt} and \code{!et} tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.

\subsection{Problems with reST/Sphinx Output}

\paragraph{Lists do not appear in .rst files.}
Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

\paragraph{Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST.}
This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline {\LaTeX} commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

\paragraph{Warning about duplicate link names.}
Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

\paragraph{Inconsistent headings in reST.}
The \code{rst2*.py} and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for \code{===},
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

\paragraph{No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks.}
The \code{!bc ipy} directive behaves this way for \code{sphinx} output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to \code{!bc cod} or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

\subsection{Problems with {\LaTeX} Output}

\paragraph{Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed.}
This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the \code{-shell-escape} command-line argument when
running \code{latex} or \code{pdflatex}:
\bsys
Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
\esys
Using \code{doconce ptex2tex} will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using \code{ptex2tex} requires the
preprocessor option \code{-DMINTED} to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, \code{latex} or \code{pdflatex} runs the
\code{pygmentize} program and the \code{shell-escape} option is required.

\paragraph{How can I use my fancy {\LaTeX} environments?.}
Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while {\LaTeX} users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by {\LaTeX} environments
via \code{doconce replace}. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code:

\bccq
<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.
\eccq
The \code{.p.tex} output file now reads
\bccq
% begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
\eccq
Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In {\LaTeX} we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the \code{% begin ...} and \code{% end ...} lines with
the proper {\LaTeX} expressions in the \code{.p.tex} file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with \emph{Theorem}.
The following Bash script does the job:
\bshpro
file=mydoc.p.tex
thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file
\eshpro
More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
\code{mydoc.p.tex} file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting \code{mydoc.tex} file now becomes
\bccq
\usepackage{theorem}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]

...

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
\eccq
Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the \code{ptex2tex} program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).

\paragraph{The {\LaTeX} file does not compile.}
If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
\bccq
\code{...}
\eccq
the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

\paragraph{Inline verbatim gives error.}
Check if the inline verbatim contains typical {\LaTeX} commands, e.g.,
\bccq
some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
then replace this by
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
capture the second }
\eccq
The remedy is to place verbatim {\LaTeX} commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.

% Could have doconce configure file where inline verbatim is
% configured to be \fontsize... directly, not via ptex2tex \code{}.

\paragraph{Errors in figure captions.}
Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar {\LaTeX} syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper \code{texttt} command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

\paragraph{Chapters are ignored.}
The default {\LaTeX} style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run \code{ptex2tex} with the option \code{-DBOOK} to set the {\LaTeX}
documentstyle to "book".

\paragraph{I want to tune the top of the {\LaTeX} file.}
The top of the {\LaTeX} file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this {\LaTeX} code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a little Bash script that performs a series of
   \code{doconce subst} (regular expressions) or \code{doconce replace} (regular text)
   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to
   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).

\item Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate
   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then
   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This
   means that the \code{doconce format latex} command does not generate
   the {\LaTeX} intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these
   files.
   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate {\LaTeX} intro and outro
   text and include the various text pieces in this file.
   To make the {\LaTeX} document, you compile all Doconce files
   into {\LaTeX} code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the
   others. That file is not used for {\LaTeX} output, but
   replaced by the hand-written {\LaTeX} "top" file.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent

\subsection{Problems with gwiki Output}

\paragraph{Strange nested lists in gwiki.}
Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the \code{.gwiki} file directly.

\paragraph{Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source.}
Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

\subsection{Problems with HTML Output}

\paragraph{How can I change the layout of the HTML page?.}
The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out \code{TITLE:} to get HTML without a header and footer). The
\code{--html-template=filename} command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title (\code{%(title)s}),
a date (\code{%(date)s}), and the main body of text (\code{%(main)s}).
For typesetting code, \code{pygments} is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by \code{--no-pygments-html} (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the \code{sphinx} format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via \code{doconce replace} and
\code{doconce subst} in the script that generates the final documents).

\paragraph{Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates?.}
The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script:

\bccq
doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
 '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
 '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html
\eccq

\subsection{Debugging}

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
\code{_doconce_debugging.log}, if the to \code{doconce format} after the filename
is \code{debug}. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.


\section{Basic Parsing Ideas}

% avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea)

The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression

\bccq
(?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?
\eccq

That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
{\LaTeX}, and work further on the document in this format.

\subsection{Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables}

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and \emph{placed at the end of
the doc string}. Note that \code{argument}, \code{keyword argument}, \code{return},
\code{instance variable}, \code{class variable}, and \code{module variable} are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.

\bccq
    - argument x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
    - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
    - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
    - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
    - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
      (bool variable).
\eccq

The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

\begin{description}
    \item[module variable x:] 
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.

    \item[module variable tolerance:] 
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
\end{description}

Doconce Description
===================

.. _what:is:doconce:

What Is Doconce?
================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via ``rst2*`` programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via ``unoconv``) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies
============================================

Doconce
-------

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at `<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>`_.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (``hg``) source follows the standard procedure::


        # Doconce
        hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version::


        cd doconce
        hg pull
        hg update
        sudo python setup.py install


Debian GNU/Linux users can also run::


        sudo apt-get install doconce

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run::


        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install doconce


Dependencies
------------

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the `Preprocess <http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_
preprocessor, this program must be installed::


        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
`Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org>`_. Its installation is most
conveniently done by ``pip``::


        pip install Mako

This command requires ``pip`` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by::


        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the ``pip`` `source code <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_.

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_,
which is installed by::


        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, ``cp2texmf.sh``::


        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that ``ptex2tex`` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by::


        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the ``~/texmf/tex/latex/misc`` directory).

Note that the ``doconce ptex2tex`` command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the ``ptex2tex``
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by ``ptex2tex`` and ``doconce ptext2tex``
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package `Pygments <http://pygments.org>`_
to be installed::


        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install


If you use the minted style together with ``ptex2tex``, you have to
enable it by the ``-DMINTED`` command-line argument to ``ptex2tex``.  All
use of the minted style requires the ``-shell-escape`` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., ``latex -shell-escape`` or ``pdflatex
-shell-escape``.

reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rst`` output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by::


        svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install::


        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths


There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
`rst2pdf <http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf>`_. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the ``rst2pdf`` directory and
run the usual ``sudo python setup.py install``.


Output to ``sphinx`` requires of course `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_,
installed by::


        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce format ``pandoc`` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the ``pandoc`` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by::


        sudo apt-get install pandoc


Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is ``epydoc`` one needs that program too, installed
by::


        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..


*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
``apt-get install`` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For ``svn`` directories, go to the directory,
run ``svn update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``. For
Mercurial (``hg``) directories, go to the directory, run
``hg pull; hg update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``.



.. Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting

.. these lines are converted to comments in the output format.

.. This may have some side effects, especially in rst and sphinx

.. where lines following the comment may be taken as part of

.. the comment if there are no blank lines after the comment.


.. One can use ## and the mako preprocessor to remove comments

.. *before* doconce sees the text. That can be useful when

.. doconce comments interferes with formatting.

.. The mako tool also supports <%doc> .. </%doc>




Demos
-----


The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the::


        docs/manual/manual.do.txt

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
`demo web page <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>`_
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file ``make.sh`` in the same directory as the ``manual.do.txt`` file
(the current text) shows how to run ``doconce format`` on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

In the ``tutorial`` directory there is also a ``make.sh`` file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
`web demo <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>`_
of the results.

.. Example on including another Doconce file:



.. _doconce2formats:

From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document ``mydoc.do.txt`` to various other
formats applies the script ``doconce format``::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable ``FORMAT`` is always defined as the current format when
running ``preprocess``. That is, in the last example, ``FORMAT`` is
defined as ``latex``. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like ``#if FORMAT == "latex"``.

The command-line arguments ``--no-preprocess`` and ``--no-mako`` turn off
running ``preprocess`` and ``mako``, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file ``mydoc.html`` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the ``pygmentize`` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument ``--no-pygments-html``
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain ``<pre>`` HTML tags. The option ``--pygments-html-linenos`` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": ``%(title)s`` for a title,
``%(date)s`` for a date, and ``%(main)s`` for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
``DATE:`` line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert ``%(title)s`` and
``%(date)s`` at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by ``%(main)s``. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html


Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is ``mydoc.mkd``.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats::


        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd

Pandoc supports ``latex``, ``html``, ``odt`` (OpenOffice), ``docx`` (Microsoft
Word), ``rtf``, ``texinfo``, to mention some. The ``-R`` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the ``--toc`` option generates a table of contents.
See the `Pandoc documentation <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html>`_
for the many features of the ``pandoc`` program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
``doconce format pandoc`` and then translating using ``pandoc``, or
``doconce format latex``, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using ``pandoc``.
Here is an example on the latter strategy::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through ``pandoc``, only single equations or ``align*``
environments are well understood.

Quite some ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst`` edits might be needed
on the ``.mkd`` or ``.tex`` files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd

The ``-s`` option adds a proper header and footer to the ``mydoc.html`` file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file ``mydoc.tex`` from ``mydoc.do.txt`` is done in two steps:
.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many

.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph

.. environment, as used here.


*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form ``mydoc.p.tex`` for
the ``ptex2tex`` program (or ``doconce ptex2tex``)::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files ``newcommands.tex``, ``newcommands_keep.tex``, or
``newcommands_replace.tex`` (see the section `Macros (Newcommands)`_).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ``ptex2tex`` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have ``ptex2tex``, you may run a (very) simplified version::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc


Note that Doconce generates a ``.p.tex`` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through ``-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional``.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
``-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage``.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 * ``BOOK`` for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)

 * ``PALATINO`` for the Palatino font

 * ``HELVETIA`` for the Helvetica font

 * ``A4PAPER`` for A4 paper size

 * ``A6PAPER`` for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)

 * ``MOVIE15`` for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies

 * ``PREAMBLE`` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)

 * ``MINTED`` for inclusion of the minted package (which requires ``latex``
   or ``pdflatex`` to be run with the ``-shell-escape`` option)

The ``ptex2tex`` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any ``!bc`` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
file, e.g., ``!bc sys`` for a terminal session, where ``sys`` is set to
a certain environment in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` (e.g., ``CodeTerminal``).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the ``doconce ptex2tex`` command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the ``.p.tex`` file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
                  -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that ``@`` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as ``minted``
above, which implies ``\begin{minted}{fortran}`` and ``\end{minted}`` as
begin and end for blocks inside ``!bc fpro`` and ``!ec``).  Specifying
``envir=ans:nt`` means that all other environments are typeset with the
``anslistings.sty`` package, e.g., ``!bc cppcod`` will then result in
``\begin{c++}``. If no environments like ``sys``, ``fpro``, or the common
``envir`` are defined on the command line, the plain ``\begin{verbatim}``
and ``\end{verbatim}`` used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the ``mydoc.tex`` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute ``section`` by ``section*`` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst``
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples::


        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile ``mydoc.tex``
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc


If one wishes to run ``ptex2tex`` and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (``Minted_Python``, ``Minted_Cpp``, etc., in
``ptex2tex`` specified through the ``*pro`` and ``*cod`` variables in
``.ptex2tex.cfg`` or ``$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg``), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running ``ptex2tex`` with the
``-DMINTED`` option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, ``latex`` must be run with the
``-shell-escape`` option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

When running ``doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted`` (or other minted
specifications with ``doconce ptex2tex``), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the ``-DMINTED`` option.


PDFLaTeX
--------

Running ``pdflatex`` instead of ``latex`` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then ``ptex2tex`` is run as explained above, and finally::


        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file ``mydoc.rst``::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice


The OpenOffice file ``mydoc.odt`` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program ``unovonv``
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run::


        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
``mydoc.odt`` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF::


        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt


*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by ``latex`` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the ``sphinx`` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords ``author``, ``title``, and ``version`` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, ``version`` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files ``file1``,
``file2``, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files ``file1``, ``file2``, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of ``dirname`` is ``sphinx-rootdir``. The ``theme``
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ``'default'``).

With a single-file document in ``mydoc.do.txt`` one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory ``sphinx-rootdir`` is made with
relevant files.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command generates a script
``automake_sphinx.py`` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run ``automake_sphinx.py`` or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` script copies directories named ``figs`` or
``figures`` over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, ``automake_sphinx.py`` must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not ``http:`` or ``file:`` URLs), must be
placed in the ``_static`` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility ``doconce sphinxfix_localURLs`` is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say ``dir1/dir2/myfile.txt`` it
replaces the link by ``_static/myfile.txt`` and copies
``dir1/dir2/myfile.txt`` to a local ``_static`` directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in ``_static`` or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all ``_static/*`` files to the
``_static`` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a ``_static`` or ``_static-name`` directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the ``conf.py``
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
``make-themes.sh`` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes ``fenics`` and ``pyramid``, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are ``_build/html_fenics``
and ``_build/html_pyramid``, respectively. Without arguments,
``make-themes.sh`` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file ``mydoc.do.txt``.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive ``sphinx-quickstart``
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated ``conf.py`` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` generator makes an extended ``conv.py``
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the ``mydoc.rst`` file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with ``mydoc.rst`` in the ``sphinx-rootdir``
directory. Either edit ``mydoc.rst`` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to ``sphinx-rootdir``.
Links to local files in ``mydoc.rst`` must be modified to links to
files in the ``_static`` directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated ``index.rst`` file so that ``mydoc.rst``
is included, i.e., add ``mydoc`` to the ``toctree`` section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before ``mydoc`` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with ``index.html`` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows ``!bc``: ``cod`` gives Python
(``code-block:: python`` in Sphinx syntax) and ``cppcod`` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
`Googlecode wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
``gwiki``, ``mwiki``, and ``cwiki``, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt


The Googlecode wiki document, ``mydoc.gwiki``, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the ``.gwiki`` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of `mwlib <http://pediapress.com/code/>`_. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write `Wikibooks <http://en.wikibooks.org>`_
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
``.rst`` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if ``.eps`` or ``.png`` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The ``make.sh`` files in ``docs/manual`` and ``docs/tutorial``
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



The Doconce Markup Language
===========================

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

Lists
-----

An unordered bullet list makes use of the ``*`` as bullet sign
and is indented as follows::


           * item 1
        
           * item 2
        
             * subitem 1, if there are more
               lines, each line must
               be intended as shown here
        
             * subitem 2,
               also spans two lines
        
           * item 3


This list gets typeset as

   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines


   * item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an ``o`` (as the first letter
in "ordered")::


           o item 1
        
           o item 2
        
             * subitem 1
        
             * subitem 2
        
           o item 3


resulting in

  1. item 1

  2. item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2


  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon::


           - keyword1: explanation of keyword1
        
           - keyword2: explanation
             of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
             if there are multiple
             lines)


The result becomes

   keyword1: 
     explanation of keyword1

   keyword2: 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)

Special Lines
-------------

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with ``TITLE:``, ``AUTHOR:``, and ``DATE:`` are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax::


        name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3

The ``at`` with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the ``and`` with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax::


        name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2

Multiple authors require multiple ``AUTHOR:`` lines. All information
associated with ``TITLE:`` and ``AUTHOR:`` keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: November 9, 2016

Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including ``rst`` and ``sphinx``)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format::


        Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
        Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
        A. Dummy Author
        
        [1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
        [2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
        [3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as ``today``.


*Table of Contents.* A table of contents can be generated by the line::


        TOC: on

This line is usually placed after the ``DATE:`` line.
A value ``off`` turns off the table of contents.


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   * 9 ``=`` characters for chapters

   * 7 for sections

   * 5 for subsections

   * 3 for subsubsections

   * 2 *underscrores* (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
*must* be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples::


        __Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
        various section headings.
        
        ========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========
        
        Some text.
        
        
        ======= Example on a Section Heading =======
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        
        ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        __A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.


Special Lines
=============

Figures
-------

.. Note: need extra blank after FIGURE and MOVIE in !bc environments

.. because doconce treats !ec as part of the caption and moves the

.. !ec up to the caption line


Figures are recognized by the special line syntax::


        FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption
        

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say ``.eps`` when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's ``convert`` utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for ``TITLE:`` and ``AUTHOR:`` lines, all information
related to a figure line *must be written on the same line*. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as ``FIGURE:`` will be
included in the formatted caption).


.. _fig:viz:

.. figure:: figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 400

   *Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow*  (fig:viz)


Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
``montage`` program from the ImageMagick suite::


        montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
                file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png

The option ``-tile XxY`` gives ``X`` figures in the horizontal direction and
``Y`` in the vertical direction (``tile 2x`` means two figures per row
and ``-tile x2`` means two rows).

Movies
------

Here is an example on the ``MOVIE:`` keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the ``latex``, ``html``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie::


        MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption
        


.. latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies,

.. or just plain \h`run: ...`_{...}


.. raw:: html
        
        <embed src="figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=600 height=470 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
        <p>
        <em></em>
        </p>



.. MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470]


.. MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470]


The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the ``movie15`` package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable ``MOVIE15``. There is an associated variable
``EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER`` which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader)::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc


The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
``myframes*.png``. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the ``MOVIE:`` command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



Copying Computer Code from Source Files
---------------------------------------

Another type of special lines starts with ``@@@CODE`` and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section `Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code`_ below.


.. _inline:tagging:

Inline Tagging
--------------

Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, **boldface phrases**,
and ``verbatim text`` (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x).

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in::


        *emphasized words*


Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk::


        _several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

The line above gets typeset as
**several words in boldface** followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks::


        `call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
        while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

The typesetting result looks like this:
``call myroutine(a, b)`` looks like a Fortran call
while ``void myfunc(double *a, double *b)`` must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and ``ptex2tex``) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as::


        some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"

which appears as some URL like `Search Google <http://google.com>`_.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in ``.txt``, ``.html``, ``.pdf``, ``.py``, ``.f``,
``.f77``, ``.f90``, ``.f95``, ``.sh``, ``.csh``, ``.ksh``, ``.zsh``,
``.c``, ``.cpp``, ``.cxx``, ``.pl``, and ``.java`` follows the same
setup::


        see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".

which appears as see the `Doconce Manual <manual.do.txt>`_.
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:

  * In the ``html`` format the links work well if the files are
    supplied with the ``.html`` with the same relative location.

  * In the ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` formats, such links in PDF files
    will unless the ``.tex`` file has a full URL specified through
    a ``\hyperbaseurl`` command and the linked files are located correctly
    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.

  * In the ``sphinx`` format, local files to which there are links should only be
    located in a ``_static`` or ``_static-name`` subdirectory.

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a ``_static`` or ``_static-name`` directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (``name`` is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the ``html`` format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
``pygmentize``, e.g.::


        Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
                  -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh

Then you can link to ``_static/make.sh.html`` instead of
``subdir/make.sh``. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as ``src/myprog.py`` in her
software and the document links to ``_static/myprog.py``::


        See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").


Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
*the filename as link text*. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes::


        URL: "manual.html"

resulting in the link `<manual.html>`_.

.. This is now automatically carried out by the autogenerated

.. script for sphinx:

.. For such local links to

.. work with the ``sphinx`` format, the ``.rst`` file needs a fix, carried

.. out by

.. !bc sys

.. doconce sphinxfix_localURLs mydoc.rst

.. 


.. (The files, such as ``manual.html``, are then copied to a subdirectory

.. ``_static``, which must be manually copied to the Sphinx directory's

.. ``_static`` directory - links in the ``.rst`` files are automatically

.. adjusted.)


Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes::


        Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

resulting in Click on this link: `<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>`_.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text::


        [name: comment]

where ``name`` is the name of the author of the command, and ``comment`` is a
plain text text. (**hpl**: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.)
The name and comment are visible in the output unless ``doconce format``
is run with a command-line argument ``--skip_inline_comments``
(see the chapter `From Doconce to Other Formats`_ for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the ``.do.txt`` file
(see the chapter `From Doconce to Other Formats`_).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII::


        Here is an example on a linear system
        ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
        where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
        $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``html``,
``sphinx``, ``mwiki``), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system Ax=b, where A
is an nxn matrix, and x and b
are vectors of length n."

Comments
--------

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as *inline comments* in Doconce and described
in the section `Inline Tagging`_.

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash ``#``::


        #
        # Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
        # These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
        #

Such comment lines may have some side effects in the ``rst`` and ``sphinx``
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out *before*
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash ``##`` and lines enclosed by
the ``<%doc>`` (beginning) and ``<%doc/>`` (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.


Cross-Referencing
-----------------

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple::


        label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
        For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
``rst`` and ``sphinx`` formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by ``doconce format``. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure `fig:viz`_
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections `LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text`_ and `Macros (Newcommands)`_ are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section `Inline Tagging`_.

Index and Bibliography
----------------------

An index can be created for the ``latex``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats
by the ``idx`` keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax::


        idx{some index entry}
        idx{main entry!subentry}
        idx{`verbatim_text` and more}

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to::


        \index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: ``idx``
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style::


        as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding ``cite`` command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like::


        as found in [3][14]

if ``Larsen_1986`` has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and ``Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999`` is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword ``BIBFILE:``,
followed by a BibTeX file with extension ``.bib``,
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension ``.rst``,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension ``.py``.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.::


        {
        'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
        K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
        URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
        """,
        'Larsen_1986':
        """
        O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
        *Personal Press*. 1986.
        """
        }


In the ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` formats, the ``.bib`` file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the ``rst`` and ``sphinx`` formats, the
``.rst`` file will be copied into the document at the place where the
``BIBFILE:`` keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the ``BIBFILE:`` line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is ``myfile.bib``.
Insert ``BIBFILE: myfile.bib`` at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the ``.rst`` file, either by manual editing
of ``myfile.bbl`` or using ``doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl`` to automate (most of)
this editing. From the ``myfile.rst`` file it is easy to create ``myfile.py``
with the dictionary version of the references.

.. see ketch/tex2rst for nice bibtex to rst converter which could

.. be used here


Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the `bibliograph.parsing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/>`_ tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [Python:Primer:09]_, a paper [Osnes:98]_,
and both of them simultaneously [Python:Primer:09]_ [Osnes:98]_.

(**somereader**: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) )


Tables
------

A table like

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters ``c``, ``r``, or ``l`` to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes ``|`` can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (``rst`` and ``sphinx`` are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



Exercises, Problems, or Projects
--------------------------------

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
*exercise*, *problem*, or *project*.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 ``=`` characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this::


        ===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{proj:moondist}

        solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt
        
        Here goes the running text of the project....
        

Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project *title*,
the *label*, the *result file*, the *solution* (if any of
these three entities is present), and the *running text*. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with ``!bsubex`` and ending
with ``!esubex``, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) *answer*, and *hints*. The environments have begin-end
directives ``!bans``, ``!eans``, ``!bsol``, ``!esol``, ``!bhint``, ``!ehint``, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
``!bc`` and ``!ec``).

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the ``solution=...`` directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        file=earth2moon.pdf
        
        Here goes the running text of the project....
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        !esubex


The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file ``.mydoc.exerinfo``,
if ``mydoc.do.txt`` is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The *title* is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem `...`_"
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".


.. _sec:verbatim:blocks:

Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code
--------------------------------

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" ``!bc`` keyword and an "end code" ``!ec`` keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the ``!bc`` tag to specify a
certain environment (for ``ptex2tex`` or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, ``!bc dat`` corresponds to
the data file environment and ``!bc cod`` is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for ``ptex2tex`` this means the ``ccq`` environment,
which is defined in the config file ``.ptex2tex.cfg``,
while for Sphinx it defaults to the ``python`` environment).

Since the config file for ``ptex2tex`` can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after ``!bc`` is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

Here, three arguments are defined: ``pycod`` for Python code,
``cod`` also for Python code, ``cppcod`` for C++ code, and ``sys``
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, ``pro`` is used for complete programs in Python, ``cod`` is
for a code snippet in Python, while ``xcod`` and ``xpro`` implies computer
language specific typesetting where ``x`` can be ``f`` for Fortran, ``c``
for C, ``cpp`` for C++, ``sh`` for Unix shells, ``pl`` for Perl, ``m`` for
Matlab, ``cy`` for Cython, and ``py`` for Python.  The argument ``sys``
means by default ``console`` for Sphinx and ``CodeTerminal`` (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are ``dat`` for a data file
or print out, and ``ipy`` for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in ``sphinx`` output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after ``!bc`` can be redefined in the
``.ptex2tex.cfg`` configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
``sphinx code-blocks`` comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.

.. (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code

.. blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments

.. and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the

.. first one is used.)


The enclosing ``!ec`` tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (``pycod`` style)::


        # regular expressions for inline tags:
        inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
        inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
        INLINE_TAGS = {
            'emphasize':
            r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'verbatim':
            r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'bold':
            r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
        }

And here is a C++ code snippet (``cppcod`` style)::


        void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
            for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
                myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
            }
        }


.. When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise

.. ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...

Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then::


         @@@CODE myfile.f
         @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

The first line implies that all lines in the file ``myfile.f`` are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a ``!bc Xpro`` environment, where
``X`` is the extension of the filename, here ``f`` (i.e., the environment
becomes ``!bc fpro`` and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a ``fromto:`` directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, ``X`` is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the ``pro`` and ``cod`` arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain ``!bc`` environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
``@`` sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching ``subroutine test``
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching ``C END1`` (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above)::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the ``fromto:``
directive above::


              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return


Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing ``fromto:`` by
``from-to`` ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text::


        # --- Start Example 1 ---
        c = -1
        A = 2
        p0 = 4
        simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
        # --- End Example 1 ---
        
        # --- Start Example 2 ---
        c = -1
        A = 1
        p0 = 0
        simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
        # --- End Example 2 ---

is easy with::


        from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2

With only ``fromto:`` this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with ``ptex2tex``: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in ``ptex2tex``. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
``.p.tex`` file to be treated by ``ptex2tex``. However, the ``@@@CODE`` line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the ``ptex2tex`` configuration
file.)


.. _mathtext:

LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text
---------------------------------

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is ``!bt`` (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
``!et``. It is important that ``!bt`` and ``!et`` appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline::


        !bt
        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}
        


Here is the result of the above ``!bt`` - ``!et`` block::

        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}


The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` has of course full support. The ``html`` format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although ``sphinx``, like ``html``, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
(``pandoc`` format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the ``latex`` format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After ``#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")`` one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
``#else`` one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.


Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.

 1. Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.

 2. Go to the Sphinx directory and load the ``conf.py`` file into
    a browser.

 3. Search for "math" and comment out the
    ``'sphinx.ext.mathjax'`` (enabled by default) and
    ``'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'`` (disabled by default)
    lines, and uncomment the ``'sphinx.ext.pngmath'`` package.
    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures
    of the mathematics.

 4. Uncomment the line with ``pngmath_dvipng_args =`` and
    set the PNG resolution to ``-D 200`` when the purpose is to
    generate mathematics pictures for slides.

 5. Run ``make html``.

 6. Look at the HTML source file in the ``_build/html``
    directory: all mathematics are in ``img`` tags with ``src=``
    pointing to a PNG file and ``alt=`` pointing to the LaTeX
    source for the formula in question. This makes it very
    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular
    mathematical expression.

.. _newcommands:

Macros (Newcommands)
--------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
``newcommand_replace.tex`` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names ``newcommands.tex`` and
``newcommands_keep.tex`` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
``!bt`` and ``!et`` in ``newcommands_keep.tex`` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
``newcommands_replace.tex`` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the ``newcommands*.tex`` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
``newcommand_replace.tex``::


        \newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
        \newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
        \newcommand{\Q}{\pmb{Q}}


and these in ``newcommands_keep.tex``::


        \newcommand{\x}{\pmb{x}}
        \newcommand{\normalvec}{\pmb{n}}
        \newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}


The LaTeX block::


        \beqa
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   label{my:eq2}
        \eeqa

will then be rendered to::

        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}

in the current format.

Preprocessing Steps
-------------------

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(`<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_) and mako
(`<http://www.makotemplates.org/>`_). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of ``name=value`` command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable ``FORMAT``
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (``html``, ``latex``,
``plain``, ``rst``, ``sphinx``, ``epydoc``, ``st``).  It is then easy to test on
the value of ``FORMAT`` and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example::


        # If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
        # PostScript files are used.
        
        # #if FORMAT == "latex"
        # Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
        \begin{figure}
        label{fig:wavepackets}
          \begin{center}
        #  #ifdef PNGFIGS
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
        #  #else
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
        #  #endif
        
        #  #ifdef PNGFIGS
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
        #  #else
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
        #  #endif
          \end{center}
          \caption{
          Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
          }
        \end{figure}
        
        # #else
        
        # Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats
        
        FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.
        
        FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.
        
        # #endif


Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section `From Doconce to Other Formats`_.

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces
---------------------------------------

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form ``#include "file.do.txt"``.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate ``.rst`` files and an index file listing the various ``.rst``
that build up the document. To generate the various ``.rst`` files one
should not run Doconce on the individual ``.do.txt`` files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script ``doconce split_rst``
to split the long, complete ``.rst`` into pieces. This process requires
that each ``#include "file.do.txt`` line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax ``#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>``, where
``file`` is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword ``part:``.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is ``master.do.txt``.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run::


        doconce format sphinx master
        # Split master.rst into parts
        # as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
        files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`
        
        dir=sphinxm-rootdir
        
        if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
          doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
                  version=1.0 theme=default $files
          sh automake_sphinx.sh
        else
          for file in $files; do
            cp $file.rst $dir
          done
          cd $dir
          make html
          cd ..
        fi

The autogenerated ``automake_sphinx.sh`` file (by ``doconce sphinx_dir``)
is compatible with a master ``.rst`` file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to ``doconce sphinx_dir``.
This set is the output of ``doconce split_rst``, which we catch in a
variable ``files`` above.


Missing Features
----------------

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line::


        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        # insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
        # #else
        # insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
        # #endif


Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say::


        # table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce ``doconce format latex mydoc`` to produce ``mydoc.p.tex``. Then
we use the ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst`` commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter::


        Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
                  '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

The ``doconce replace from_text to_text filename`` command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the ``replace`` method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with ``\tableofcontents``, we should use ``doconce subst``,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character::


        Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
                  '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

Note the double backshlash in front of the ``t`` character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The ``doconce subst`` is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

Header and Footer
-----------------

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if ``TITLE:`` or
``#TITLE:`` is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


Emacs Doconce Formatter
-----------------------

The file ``misc/.doconce-mode.el`` in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

*Step 1.* Download the Doconce tarball from ``code.google.com/p/doconce``,
pack it out and go to the root directory.

*Step 2.* Copy the ``doconce-mode.el`` file to the home directory::


        cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME


*Step 3.* Add these lines to ``$HOME/.emacs``::


        (load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
        (setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))

Emacs will now recognize files with extension ``.do.txt`` and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.


Troubleshooting
===============

Disclaimer
----------

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running ``doconce format``, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


General Problems
----------------

Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce automatically removes the file ``__tmp.do.txt``, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when ``mako`` and/or
``preprocess`` is run). Add the ``--debug`` flag at the end of the
``doconce`` command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
``__tmp.do.txt`` is deleted.

Figure captions are incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

Preprocessor directives do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

Problems with boldface and emphasize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

Links to local directories do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links of the type::


        see the "examples directory": "src/examples"

do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file::


        see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"


Links are not typeset correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim::


        see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".

However, the following will not be typeset correctly::


        see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"

The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.


Inline verbatim code is not detected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

Strange non-English characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the encoding of the ``.do.txt`` file with the Unix ``file`` command
or with::


        Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands::


        Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
        
        Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile


Wrong Norwegian charcters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run ``doconce change_encoding`` to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

Too short underlining of reST headlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.


Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first ``!bt`` (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

Problems with code or Tex Blocks
--------------------------------

Code or math block errors in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a ``!bc``, which should have been removed when
running ``doconce format sphinx``, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then ``!bc`` will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``idx`` commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

Something is wrong with a verbatim code block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before ``!bt`` and ``!bc`` environments.

Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the the section `Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code`_ above.  Start the
``!bc`` and ``!ec`` tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the ``!bt`` and ``!et`` tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


Problems with reST/Sphinx Output
--------------------------------

Lists do not appear in .rst files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

Warning about duplicate link names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

Inconsistent headings in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rst2*.py`` and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for ``===``,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``!bc ipy`` directive behaves this way for ``sphinx`` output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to ``!bc cod`` or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

Problems with LaTeX Output
--------------------------

Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the ``-shell-escape`` command-line argument when
running ``latex`` or ``pdflatex``::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex

Using ``doconce ptex2tex`` will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using ``ptex2tex`` requires the
preprocessor option ``-DMINTED`` to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, ``latex`` or ``pdflatex`` runs the
``pygmentize`` program and the ``shell-escape`` option is required.

How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via ``doconce replace``. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code::


        <%
        theorem_counter = 4
        %>
        
        # begin theorem
        label{theorem:fundamental1}
        <%
        theorem_counter += 1
        theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
        %>
        
        __Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        # end theorem
        
        # begin proof
        __Proof.__
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$|$END$
        # end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
        achievement.

The ``.p.tex`` output file now reads::


        % begin theorem
        label{theorem:fundamental1}
        
        
        \paragraph{Theorem 5.}
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        % end theorem
        
        % begin proof
        \paragraph{Proof.}
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$
        % end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
        achievement.

Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the ``% begin ...`` and ``% end ...`` lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the ``.p.tex`` file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with *Theorem*.
The following Bash script does the job::


        file=mydoc.p.tex
        thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
        doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
        doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
        doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
        doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file

More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
``mydoc.p.tex`` file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting ``mydoc.tex`` file now becomes::


        \usepackage{theorem}
        \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]
        
        ...
        
        \begin{theorem}
        \label{theorem:fundamental1}
        
        
        
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        \end{theorem}
        
        % begin proof
        \paragraph{Proof.}
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$
        % end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
        achievement.

Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the ``ptex2tex`` program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).


The LaTeX file does not compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving::


        \code{...}

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

Inline verbatim gives error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.::


        some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
        ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
        then replace this by
        {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
        which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
        capture the second }

The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.

.. Could have doconce configure file where inline verbatim is

.. configured to be \fontsize... directly, not via ptex2tex \code{}.



Errors in figure captions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper ``texttt`` command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

Chapters are ignored
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run ``ptex2tex`` with the option ``-DBOOK`` to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:

1. Make a little Bash script that performs a series of
   ``doconce subst`` (regular expressions) or ``doconce replace`` (regular text)
   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to
   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).

2. Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate
   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then
   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This
   means that the ``doconce format latex`` command does not generate
   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these
   files.
   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro
   text and include the various text pieces in this file.
   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files
   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the
   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but
   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.

Problems with gwiki Output
--------------------------

Strange nested lists in gwiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the ``.gwiki`` file directly.

Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

Problems with HTML Output
-------------------------

How can I change the layout of the HTML page?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out ``TITLE:`` to get HTML without a header and footer). The
``--html-template=filename`` command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title (``%(title)s``),
a date (``%(date)s``), and the main body of text (``%(main)s``).
For typesetting code, ``pygments`` is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by ``--no-pygments-html`` (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the ``sphinx`` format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via ``doconce replace`` and
``doconce subst`` in the script that generates the final documents).

Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script::


        doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
         '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
        doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
         '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html



Debugging
---------

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
``_doconce_debugging.log``, if the to ``doconce format`` after the filename
is ``debug``. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



Basic Parsing Ideas
===================

.. avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea)


The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression::


        (?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?


That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that ``argument``, ``keyword argument``, ``return``,
``instance variable``, ``class variable``, and ``module variable`` are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted::


            - argument x: x value (float),
              which must be a positive number.
            - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
              the iterations.
            - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
            - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
            - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
            - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
              (bool variable).


The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    module variable x: 
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.

    module variable tolerance: 
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

What Is Doconce?
================

.. index::
   pair: doconce; short explanation


Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via ``rst2*`` programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via ``unoconv``) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies
============================================

Doconce
-------

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at `<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>`_.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (``hg``) source follows the standard procedure:

.. code-block:: console

        # Doconce
        hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:

.. code-block:: console

        cd doconce
        hg pull
        hg update
        sudo python setup.py install


Debian GNU/Linux users can also run

.. code-block:: console

        sudo apt-get install doconce

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run

.. code-block:: console

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install doconce


Dependencies
------------

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the `Preprocess <http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_
preprocessor, this program must be installed:


.. code-block:: console

        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
`Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org>`_. Its installation is most
conveniently done by ``pip``,


.. code-block:: console

        pip install Mako

This command requires ``pip`` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by


.. code-block:: console

        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the ``pip`` `source code <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_.

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_,
which is installed by


.. code-block:: console

        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, ``cp2texmf.sh``:


.. code-block:: console

        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that ``ptex2tex`` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by


.. code-block:: console

        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the ``~/texmf/tex/latex/misc`` directory).

Note that the ``doconce ptex2tex`` command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the ``ptex2tex``
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by ``ptex2tex`` and ``doconce ptext2tex``
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package `Pygments <http://pygments.org>`_
to be installed:

.. code-block:: console

        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install


If you use the minted style together with ``ptex2tex``, you have to
enable it by the ``-DMINTED`` command-line argument to ``ptex2tex``.  All
use of the minted style requires the ``-shell-escape`` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., ``latex -shell-escape`` or ``pdflatex
-shell-escape``.

.. Say something about anslistings.sty


reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rst`` output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by


.. code-block:: console

        svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install

.. code-block:: console

        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths


There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
`rst2pdf <http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf>`_. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the ``rst2pdf`` directory and
run the usual ``sudo python setup.py install``.


Output to ``sphinx`` requires of course `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_,
installed by

.. code-block:: console

        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce format ``pandoc`` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the ``pandoc`` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by


.. code-block:: console

        sudo apt-get install pandoc


Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is ``epydoc`` one needs that program too, installed
by

.. code-block:: console

        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..


*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
``apt-get install`` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For ``svn`` directories, go to the directory,
run ``svn update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``. For
Mercurial (``hg``) directories, go to the directory, run
``hg pull; hg update``, and then ``sudo python setup.py install``.



.. Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting

.. these lines are converted to comments in the output format.

.. This may have some side effects, especially in rst and sphinx

.. where lines following the comment may be taken as part of

.. the comment if there are no blank lines after the comment.


.. One can use ## and the mako preprocessor to remove comments

.. *before* doconce sees the text. That can be useful when

.. doconce comments interferes with formatting.

.. The mako tool also supports <%doc> .. </%doc>




Demos
-----


.. index:: demos


The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the

.. code-block:: console

        docs/manual/manual.do.txt

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
`demo web page <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>`_
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file ``make.sh`` in the same directory as the ``manual.do.txt`` file
(the current text) shows how to run ``doconce format`` on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in

.. code-block:: console

        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

In the ``tutorial`` directory there is also a ``make.sh`` file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
`web demo <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>`_
of the results.

.. Example on including another Doconce file:



.. _doconce2formats:

From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document ``mydoc.do.txt`` to various other
formats applies the script ``doconce format``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` can be added after the
filename. For example,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable ``FORMAT`` is always defined as the current format when
running ``preprocess``. That is, in the last example, ``FORMAT`` is
defined as ``latex``. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like ``#if FORMAT == "latex"``.

The command-line arguments ``--no-preprocess`` and ``--no-mako`` turn off
running ``preprocess`` and ``mako``, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:

.. code-block:: py


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is performed by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file ``mydoc.html`` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the ``pygmentize`` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument ``--no-pygments-html``
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain ``<pre>`` HTML tags. The option ``--pygments-html-linenos`` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": ``%(title)s`` for a title,
``%(date)s`` for a date, and ``%(main)s`` for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
``DATE:`` line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert ``%(title)s`` and
``%(date)s`` at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by ``%(main)s``. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html


Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is ``mydoc.mkd``.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd

Pandoc supports ``latex``, ``html``, ``odt`` (OpenOffice), ``docx`` (Microsoft
Word), ``rtf``, ``texinfo``, to mention some. The ``-R`` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the ``--toc`` option generates a table of contents.
See the `Pandoc documentation <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html>`_
for the many features of the ``pandoc`` program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
``doconce format pandoc`` and then translating using ``pandoc``, or
``doconce format latex``, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using ``pandoc``.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through ``pandoc``, only single equations or ``align*``
environments are well understood.

Quite some ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst`` edits might be needed
on the ``.mkd`` or ``.tex`` files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd

The ``-s`` option adds a proper header and footer to the ``mydoc.html`` file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file ``mydoc.tex`` from ``mydoc.do.txt`` is done in two steps:
.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many

.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph

.. environment, as used here.


*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form ``mydoc.p.tex`` for
the ``ptex2tex`` program (or ``doconce ptex2tex``):

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files ``newcommands.tex``, ``newcommands_keep.tex``, or
``newcommands_replace.tex`` (see the section :ref:`newcommands`).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ``ptex2tex`` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have ``ptex2tex``, you may run a (very) simplified version:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc


Note that Doconce generates a ``.p.tex`` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through ``-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional``.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
``-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage``.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 * ``BOOK`` for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)

 * ``PALATINO`` for the Palatino font

 * ``HELVETIA`` for the Helvetica font

 * ``A4PAPER`` for A4 paper size

 * ``A6PAPER`` for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)

 * ``MOVIE15`` for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies

 * ``PREAMBLE`` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)

 * ``MINTED`` for inclusion of the minted package (which requires ``latex``
   or ``pdflatex`` to be run with the ``-shell-escape`` option)

The ``ptex2tex`` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any ``!bc`` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
file, e.g., ``!bc sys`` for a terminal session, where ``sys`` is set to
a certain environment in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` (e.g., ``CodeTerminal``).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the ``doconce ptex2tex`` command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the ``.p.tex`` file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
                  -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that ``@`` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as ``minted``
above, which implies ``\begin{minted}{fortran}`` and ``\end{minted}`` as
begin and end for blocks inside ``!bc fpro`` and ``!ec``).  Specifying
``envir=ans:nt`` means that all other environments are typeset with the
``anslistings.sty`` package, e.g., ``!bc cppcod`` will then result in
``\begin{c++}``. If no environments like ``sys``, ``fpro``, or the common
``envir`` are defined on the command line, the plain ``\begin{verbatim}``
and ``\end{verbatim}`` used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the ``mydoc.tex`` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute ``section`` by ``section*`` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst``
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile ``mydoc.tex``
and create the PDF file:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc


If one wishes to run ``ptex2tex`` and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (``Minted_Python``, ``Minted_Cpp``, etc., in
``ptex2tex`` specified through the ``*pro`` and ``*cod`` variables in
``.ptex2tex.cfg`` or ``$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg``), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running ``ptex2tex`` with the
``-DMINTED`` option:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, ``latex`` must be run with the
``-shell-escape`` option:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

When running ``doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted`` (or other minted
specifications with ``doconce ptex2tex``), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the ``-DMINTED`` option.


PDFLaTeX
--------

Running ``pdflatex`` instead of ``latex`` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then ``ptex2tex`` is run as explained above, and finally

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file ``mydoc.rst``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice


The OpenOffice file ``mydoc.odt`` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program ``unovonv``
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
``mydoc.odt`` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt


*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by ``latex`` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the ``sphinx`` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords ``author``, ``title``, and ``version`` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, ``version`` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files ``file1``,
``file2``, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files ``file1``, ``file2``, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of ``dirname`` is ``sphinx-rootdir``. The ``theme``
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ``'default'``).

With a single-file document in ``mydoc.do.txt`` one often just runs

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory ``sphinx-rootdir`` is made with
relevant files.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command generates a script
``automake_sphinx.py`` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run ``automake_sphinx.py`` or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` script copies directories named ``figs`` or
``figures`` over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, ``automake_sphinx.py`` must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not ``http:`` or ``file:`` URLs), must be
placed in the ``_static`` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility ``doconce sphinxfix_localURLs`` is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say ``dir1/dir2/myfile.txt`` it
replaces the link by ``_static/myfile.txt`` and copies
``dir1/dir2/myfile.txt`` to a local ``_static`` directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in ``_static`` or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all ``_static/*`` files to the
``_static`` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a ``_static`` or ``_static-name`` directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the ``conf.py``
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
``make-themes.sh`` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes ``fenics`` and ``pyramid``, one writes

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are ``_build/html_fenics``
and ``_build/html_pyramid``, respectively. Without arguments,
``make-themes.sh`` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file ``mydoc.do.txt``.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive ``sphinx-quickstart``
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:

.. code-block:: console

        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated ``conf.py`` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` generator makes an extended ``conv.py``
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the ``mydoc.rst`` file to the Sphinx root directory:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with ``mydoc.rst`` in the ``sphinx-rootdir``
directory. Either edit ``mydoc.rst`` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to ``sphinx-rootdir``.
Links to local files in ``mydoc.rst`` must be modified to links to
files in the ``_static`` directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated ``index.rst`` file so that ``mydoc.rst``
is included, i.e., add ``mydoc`` to the ``toctree`` section so that it becomes

.. code-block:: py


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before ``mydoc`` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:

.. code-block:: console

        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with ``index.html`` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows ``!bc``: ``cod`` gives Python
(``code-block:: python`` in Sphinx syntax) and ``cppcod`` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
`Googlecode wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
``gwiki``, ``mwiki``, and ``cwiki``, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt


The Googlecode wiki document, ``mydoc.gwiki``, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the ``.gwiki`` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of `mwlib <http://pediapress.com/code/>`_. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write `Wikibooks <http://en.wikibooks.org>`_
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
``.rst`` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if ``.eps`` or ``.png`` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The ``make.sh`` files in ``docs/manual`` and ``docs/tutorial``
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



The Doconce Markup Language
===========================

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

Lists
-----

An unordered bullet list makes use of the ``*`` as bullet sign
and is indented as follows


.. code-block:: py


           * item 1
        
           * item 2
        
             * subitem 1, if there are more
               lines, each line must
               be intended as shown here
        
             * subitem 2,
               also spans two lines
        
           * item 3


This list gets typeset as

   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines


   * item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an ``o`` (as the first letter
in "ordered"):


.. code-block:: py


           o item 1
        
           o item 2
        
             * subitem 1
        
             * subitem 2
        
           o item 3


resulting in

  1. item 1

  2. item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2


  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:


.. code-block:: py


           - keyword1: explanation of keyword1
        
           - keyword2: explanation
             of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
             if there are multiple
             lines)


The result becomes

   keyword1: 
     explanation of keyword1

   keyword2: 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)

Special Lines
-------------

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


.. index:: TITLE keyword

.. index:: AUTHOR keyword

.. index:: DATE keyword


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with ``TITLE:``, ``AUTHOR:``, and ``DATE:`` are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax

.. code-block:: py


        name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3

The ``at`` with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the ``and`` with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax

.. code-block:: py


        name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2

Multiple authors require multiple ``AUTHOR:`` lines. All information
associated with ``TITLE:`` and ``AUTHOR:`` keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:

.. code-block:: py


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: November 9, 2016

Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including ``rst`` and ``sphinx``)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:

.. code-block:: py


        Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
        Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
        A. Dummy Author
        
        [1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
        [2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
        [3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as ``today``.


.. index:: TOC keyword


*Table of Contents.* A table of contents can be generated by the line

.. code-block:: py


        TOC: on

This line is usually placed after the ``DATE:`` line.
A value ``off`` turns off the table of contents.


.. index:: headlines

.. index:: section headings


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   * 9 ``=`` characters for chapters

   * 7 for sections

   * 5 for subsections

   * 3 for subsubsections

   * 2 *underscrores* (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
*must* be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: py


        __Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
        various section headings.
        
        ========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========
        
        Some text.
        
        
        ======= Example on a Section Heading =======
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        
        ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        __A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.


Special Lines
=============

Figures
-------

.. Note: need extra blank after FIGURE and MOVIE in !bc environments

.. because doconce treats !ec as part of the caption and moves the

.. !ec up to the caption line


Figures are recognized by the special line syntax

.. code-block:: py


        FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption
        

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say ``.eps`` when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's ``convert`` utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for ``TITLE:`` and ``AUTHOR:`` lines, all information
related to a figure line *must be written on the same line*. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as ``FIGURE:`` will be
included in the formatted caption).


.. _fig:viz:

.. figure:: figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 400

   *Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow*


Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
``montage`` program from the ImageMagick suite:

.. code-block:: console

        montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
                file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png

The option ``-tile XxY`` gives ``X`` figures in the horizontal direction and
``Y`` in the vertical direction (``tile 2x`` means two figures per row
and ``-tile x2`` means two rows).

Movies
------

Here is an example on the ``MOVIE:`` keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the ``latex``, ``html``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.

.. code-block:: py


        MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption
        


.. latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies,

.. or just plain \h:ref:`run: ...`{...}


.. raw:: html
        
        <embed src="figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=600 height=470 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
        <p>
        <em></em>
        </p>



.. MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470]


.. MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470]


The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the ``movie15`` package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable ``MOVIE15``. There is an associated variable
``EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER`` which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc


The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
``myframes*.png``. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the ``MOVIE:`` command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



Copying Computer Code from Source Files
---------------------------------------

Another type of special lines starts with ``@@@CODE`` and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section :ref:`sec:verbatim:blocks` below.


.. _inline:tagging:

Inline Tagging
--------------

.. index:: inline tagging

.. index:: emphasized words

.. index:: boldface words

.. index:: verbatim text


.. index:: inline comments


Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, **boldface phrases**,
and ``verbatim text`` (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as :math:`\nu = \sin(x)`.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in

.. code-block:: py


        *emphasized words*


Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:

.. code-block:: py


        _several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

The line above gets typeset as
**several words in boldface** followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks:

.. code-block:: py


        `call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
        while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

The typesetting result looks like this:
``call myroutine(a, b)`` looks like a Fortran call
while ``void myfunc(double *a, double *b)`` must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and ``ptex2tex``) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as

.. code-block:: py


        some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"

which appears as some URL like `Search Google <http://google.com>`_.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in ``.txt``, ``.html``, ``.pdf``, ``.py``, ``.f``,
``.f77``, ``.f90``, ``.f95``, ``.sh``, ``.csh``, ``.ksh``, ``.zsh``,
``.c``, ``.cpp``, ``.cxx``, ``.pl``, and ``.java`` follows the same
setup:

.. code-block:: py


        see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".

which appears as see the `Doconce Manual <manual.do.txt>`_.
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:

  * In the ``html`` format the links work well if the files are
    supplied with the ``.html`` with the same relative location.

  * In the ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` formats, such links in PDF files
    will unless the ``.tex`` file has a full URL specified through
    a ``\hyperbaseurl`` command and the linked files are located correctly
    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.

  * In the ``sphinx`` format, local files to which there are links should only be
    located in a ``_static`` or ``_static-name`` subdirectory.

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a ``_static`` or ``_static-name`` directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (``name`` is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the ``html`` format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
``pygmentize``, e.g.,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
                  -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh

Then you can link to ``_static/make.sh.html`` instead of
``subdir/make.sh``. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as ``src/myprog.py`` in her
software and the document links to ``_static/myprog.py``:

.. code-block:: py


        See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").


Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
*the filename as link text*. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:

.. code-block:: py


        URL: "manual.html"

resulting in the link `<manual.html>`_.

.. This is now automatically carried out by the autogenerated

.. script for sphinx:

.. For such local links to

.. work with the ``sphinx`` format, the ``.rst`` file needs a fix, carried

.. out by

.. !bc sys

.. doconce sphinxfix_localURLs mydoc.rst

.. 


.. (The files, such as ``manual.html``, are then copied to a subdirectory

.. ``_static``, which must be manually copied to the Sphinx directory's

.. ``_static`` directory - links in the ``.rst`` files are automatically

.. adjusted.)


Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:

.. code-block:: py


        Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

resulting in Click on this link: `<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>`_.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:

.. code-block:: py


        [name: comment]

where ``name`` is the name of the author of the command, and ``comment`` is a
plain text text. (**hpl**: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.)
The name and comment are visible in the output unless ``doconce format``
is run with a command-line argument ``--skip_inline_comments``
(see the chapter :ref:`doconce2formats` for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the ``.do.txt`` file
(see the chapter :ref:`doconce2formats`).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII:


.. code-block:: py


        Here is an example on a linear system
        ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
        where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
        $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (``latex``, ``pdflatex``, ``html``,
``sphinx``, ``mwiki``), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system :math:`{\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}`, where :math:`\bf A`
is an :math:`n\times n` matrix, and :math:`\bf x` and :math:`\bf b`
are vectors of length :math:`n`."

Comments
--------

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as *inline comments* in Doconce and described
in the section :ref:`inline:tagging`.

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash ``#``:

.. code-block:: py


        #
        # Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
        # These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
        #

Such comment lines may have some side effects in the ``rst`` and ``sphinx``
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out *before*
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash ``##`` and lines enclosed by
the ``<%doc>`` (beginning) and ``<%doc/>`` (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.


Cross-Referencing
-----------------

.. index:: cross referencing

.. index:: labels

.. index:: references


References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:

.. code-block:: py


        label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
        For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
``rst`` and ``sphinx`` formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by ``doconce format``. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure :ref:`fig:viz`
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections :ref:`mathtext` and :ref:`newcommands` are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say (:ref:`my:eq1`)--(:ref:`my:eq2`). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section :ref:`inline:tagging`.

Index and Bibliography
----------------------

.. index:: index

.. index:: citations

.. index:: bibliography


An index can be created for the ``latex``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats
by the ``idx`` keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:

.. code-block:: py


        idx{some index entry}
        idx{main entry!subentry}
        idx{`verbatim_text` and more}

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to

.. code-block:: py


        \index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: ``idx``
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:

.. code-block:: py


        as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding ``cite`` command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like

.. code-block:: py


        as found in [3][14]

if ``Larsen_1986`` has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and ``Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999`` is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword ``BIBFILE:``,
followed by a BibTeX file with extension ``.bib``,
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension ``.rst``,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension ``.py``.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,

.. code-block:: py


        {
        'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
        K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
        URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
        """,
        'Larsen_1986':
        """
        O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
        *Personal Press*. 1986.
        """
        }


In the ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` formats, the ``.bib`` file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the ``rst`` and ``sphinx`` formats, the
``.rst`` file will be copied into the document at the place where the
``BIBFILE:`` keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the ``BIBFILE:`` line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is ``myfile.bib``.
Insert ``BIBFILE: myfile.bib`` at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the ``.rst`` file, either by manual editing
of ``myfile.bbl`` or using ``doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl`` to automate (most of)
this editing. From the ``myfile.rst`` file it is easy to create ``myfile.py``
with the dictionary version of the references.

Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the `bibliograph.parsing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/>`_ tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [Python:Primer:09]_, a paper [Osnes:98]_,
and both of them simultaneously [Python:Primer:09]_ [Osnes:98]_.

(**somereader**: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) )


Tables
------

A table like

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:

.. code-block:: py


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters ``c``, ``r``, or ``l`` to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes ``|`` can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (``rst`` and ``sphinx`` are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



Exercises, Problems, or Projects
--------------------------------

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
*exercise*, *problem*, or *project*.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 ``=`` characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this:

.. code-block:: py


        ===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{proj:moondist}
        file=earth2moon.pdf
        solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt
        
        Here goes the running text of the project....
        

Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project *title*,
the *label*, the *result file*, the *solution* (if any of
these three entities is present), and the *running text*. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with ``!bsubex`` and ending
with ``!esubex``, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) *answer*, and *hints*. The environments have begin-end
directives ``!bans``, ``!eans``, ``!bsol``, ``!esol``, ``!bhint``, ``!ehint``, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
``!bc`` and ``!ec``).

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the ``solution=...`` directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows:

.. code-block:: py


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        file=earth2moon.pdf
        
        Here goes the running text of the project....
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        !esubex


The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file ``.mydoc.exerinfo``,
if ``mydoc.do.txt`` is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The *title* is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem :ref:`...`"
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".


.. _sec:verbatim:blocks:

Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code
--------------------------------

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" ``!bc`` keyword and an "end code" ``!ec`` keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the ``!bc`` tag to specify a
certain environment (for ``ptex2tex`` or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, ``!bc dat`` corresponds to
the data file environment and ``!bc cod`` is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for ``ptex2tex`` this means the ``ccq`` environment,
which is defined in the config file ``.ptex2tex.cfg``,
while for Sphinx it defaults to the ``python`` environment).

Since the config file for ``ptex2tex`` can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after ``!bc`` is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.,

.. code-block:: py


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

Here, three arguments are defined: ``pycod`` for Python code,
``cod`` also for Python code, ``cppcod`` for C++ code, and ``sys``
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, ``pro`` is used for complete programs in Python, ``cod`` is
for a code snippet in Python, while ``xcod`` and ``xpro`` implies computer
language specific typesetting where ``x`` can be ``f`` for Fortran, ``c``
for C, ``cpp`` for C++, ``sh`` for Unix shells, ``pl`` for Perl, ``m`` for
Matlab, ``cy`` for Cython, and ``py`` for Python.  The argument ``sys``
means by default ``console`` for Sphinx and ``CodeTerminal`` (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are ``dat`` for a data file
or print out, and ``ipy`` for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in ``sphinx`` output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after ``!bc`` can be redefined in the
``.ptex2tex.cfg`` configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
``sphinx code-blocks`` comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.

.. (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code

.. blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments

.. and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the

.. first one is used.)


The enclosing ``!ec`` tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (``pycod`` style):

.. code-block:: python

        # regular expressions for inline tags:
        inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
        inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
        INLINE_TAGS = {
            'emphasize':
            r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'verbatim':
            r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'bold':
            r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
        }

And here is a C++ code snippet (``cppcod`` style):

.. code-block:: c++

        void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
            for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
                myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
            }
        }


.. When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise

.. ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...

Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then

.. code-block:: py


         @@@CODE myfile.f
         @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

The first line implies that all lines in the file ``myfile.f`` are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a ``!bc Xpro`` environment, where
``X`` is the extension of the filename, here ``f`` (i.e., the environment
becomes ``!bc fpro`` and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a ``fromto:`` directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, ``X`` is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the ``pro`` and ``cod`` arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain ``!bc`` environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
``@`` sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching ``subroutine test``
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching ``C END1`` (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):


.. code-block:: fortran

        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the ``fromto:``
directive above:


.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return


Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing ``fromto:`` by
``from-to`` ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text

.. code-block:: python

        # --- Start Example 1 ---
        c = -1
        A = 2
        p0 = 4
        simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
        # --- End Example 1 ---
        
        # --- Start Example 2 ---
        c = -1
        A = 1
        p0 = 0
        simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
        # --- End Example 2 ---

is easy with

.. code-block:: py


        from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2

With only ``fromto:`` this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with ``ptex2tex``: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in ``ptex2tex``. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
``.p.tex`` file to be treated by ``ptex2tex``. However, the ``@@@CODE`` line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the ``ptex2tex`` configuration
file.)


.. _mathtext:

LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text
---------------------------------

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is ``!bt`` (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
``!et``. It is important that ``!bt`` and ``!et`` appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.

.. code-block:: py


        
.. math::
        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}
        


Here is the result of the above ``!bt`` - ``!et`` block:

.. math::
   :label: myeq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        


The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` has of course full support. The ``html`` format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although ``sphinx``, like ``html``, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
(``pandoc`` format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the ``latex`` format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After ``#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")`` one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
``#else`` one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.


Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.

 1. Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.

 2. Go to the Sphinx directory and load the ``conf.py`` file into
    a browser.

 3. Search for "math" and comment out the
    ``'sphinx.ext.mathjax'`` (enabled by default) and
    ``'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'`` (disabled by default)
    lines, and uncomment the ``'sphinx.ext.pngmath'`` package.
    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures
    of the mathematics.

 4. Uncomment the line with ``pngmath_dvipng_args =`` and
    set the PNG resolution to ``-D 200`` when the purpose is to
    generate mathematics pictures for slides.

 5. Run ``make html``.

 6. Look at the HTML source file in the ``_build/html``
    directory: all mathematics are in ``img`` tags with ``src=``
    pointing to a PNG file and ``alt=`` pointing to the LaTeX
    source for the formula in question. This makes it very
    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular
    mathematical expression.

.. _newcommands:

Macros (Newcommands)
--------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
``newcommand_replace.tex`` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names ``newcommands.tex`` and
``newcommands_keep.tex`` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
``!bt`` and ``!et`` in ``newcommands_keep.tex`` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
``newcommands_replace.tex`` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the ``newcommands*.tex`` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
``newcommand_replace.tex``:


.. code-block:: python

        \newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
        \newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
        \newcommand{\Q}{\pmb{Q}}


and these in ``newcommands_keep.tex``:


.. code-block:: python

        \newcommand{\x}{\pmb{x}}
        \newcommand{\normalvec}{\pmb{n}}
        \newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}


The LaTeX block

.. code-block:: py


        \beqa
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   label{my:eq2}
        \eeqa

will then be rendered to

.. math::
   :label: myeq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        

in the current format.

Preprocessing Steps
-------------------

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(`<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_) and mako
(`<http://www.makotemplates.org/>`_). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of ``name=value`` command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable ``FORMAT``
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (``html``, ``latex``,
``plain``, ``rst``, ``sphinx``, ``epydoc``, ``st``).  It is then easy to test on
the value of ``FORMAT`` and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example:


.. code-block:: python

        # If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
        # PostScript files are used.
        
        # #if FORMAT == "latex"
        # Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
        \begin{figure}
        label{fig:wavepackets}
          \begin{center}
        #  #ifdef PNGFIGS
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
        #  #else
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
        #  #endif
        
        #  #ifdef PNGFIGS
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
        #  #else
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
        #  #endif
          \end{center}
          \caption{
          Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
          }
        \end{figure}
        
        # #else
        
        # Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats
        
        FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.
        
        FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.
        
        # #endif


Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section :ref:`doconce2formats`.

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces
---------------------------------------

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form ``#include "file.do.txt"``.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate ``.rst`` files and an index file listing the various ``.rst``
that build up the document. To generate the various ``.rst`` files one
should not run Doconce on the individual ``.do.txt`` files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script ``doconce split_rst``
to split the long, complete ``.rst`` into pieces. This process requires
that each ``#include "file.do.txt`` line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax ``#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>``, where
``file`` is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword ``part:``.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is ``master.do.txt``.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run

.. code-block:: python

        doconce format sphinx master
        # Split master.rst into parts
        # as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
        files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`
        
        dir=sphinxm-rootdir
        
        if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
          doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
                  version=1.0 theme=default $files
          sh automake_sphinx.sh
        else
          for file in $files; do
            cp $file.rst $dir
          done
          cd $dir
          make html
          cd ..
        fi

The autogenerated ``automake_sphinx.sh`` file (by ``doconce sphinx_dir``)
is compatible with a master ``.rst`` file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to ``doconce sphinx_dir``.
This set is the output of ``doconce split_rst``, which we catch in a
variable ``files`` above.


Missing Features
----------------

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line


.. code-block:: python

        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        # insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
        # #else
        # insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
        # #endif


Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say

.. code-block:: py


        # table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce ``doconce format latex mydoc`` to produce ``mydoc.p.tex``. Then
we use the ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst`` commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:

.. code-block:: py


        Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
                  '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

The ``doconce replace from_text to_text filename`` command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the ``replace`` method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with ``\tableofcontents``, we should use ``doconce subst``,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:

.. code-block:: py


        Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
                  '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

Note the double backshlash in front of the ``t`` character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The ``doconce subst`` is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

Header and Footer
-----------------

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if ``TITLE:`` or
``#TITLE:`` is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


Emacs Doconce Formatter
-----------------------

The file ``misc/.doconce-mode.el`` in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

*Step 1.* Download the Doconce tarball from ``code.google.com/p/doconce``,
pack it out and go to the root directory.

*Step 2.* Copy the ``doconce-mode.el`` file to the home directory:

.. code-block:: py


        cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME


*Step 3.* Add these lines to ``$HOME/.emacs``:

.. code-block:: py


        (load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
        (setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))

Emacs will now recognize files with extension ``.do.txt`` and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.


Troubleshooting
===============

Disclaimer
----------

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running ``doconce format``, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


General Problems
----------------

Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce automatically removes the file ``__tmp.do.txt``, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when ``mako`` and/or
``preprocess`` is run). Add the ``--debug`` flag at the end of the
``doconce`` command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
``__tmp.do.txt`` is deleted.

Figure captions are incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

Preprocessor directives do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

Problems with boldface and emphasize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

Links to local directories do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links of the type

.. code-block:: py


        see the "examples directory": "src/examples"

do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file:

.. code-block:: py


        see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"


Links are not typeset correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim:

.. code-block:: py


        see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".

However, the following will not be typeset correctly:

.. code-block:: py


        see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"

The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.


Inline verbatim code is not detected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

Strange non-English characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the encoding of the ``.do.txt`` file with the Unix ``file`` command
or with

.. code-block:: py


        Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands

.. code-block:: py


        Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
        
        Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile


Wrong Norwegian charcters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run ``doconce change_encoding`` to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

Too short underlining of reST headlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.


Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first ``!bt`` (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

Problems with code or Tex Blocks
--------------------------------

Code or math block errors in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a ``!bc``, which should have been removed when
running ``doconce format sphinx``, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then ``!bc`` will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``idx`` commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

Something is wrong with a verbatim code block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before ``!bt`` and ``!bc`` environments.

Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the the section :ref:`sec:verbatim:blocks` above.  Start the
``!bc`` and ``!ec`` tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the ``!bt`` and ``!et`` tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


Problems with reST/Sphinx Output
--------------------------------

Lists do not appear in .rst files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

Warning about duplicate link names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

Inconsistent headings in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rst2*.py`` and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for ``===``,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``!bc ipy`` directive behaves this way for ``sphinx`` output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to ``!bc cod`` or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

Problems with LaTeX Output
--------------------------

Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the ``-shell-escape`` command-line argument when
running ``latex`` or ``pdflatex``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex

Using ``doconce ptex2tex`` will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using ``ptex2tex`` requires the
preprocessor option ``-DMINTED`` to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, ``latex`` or ``pdflatex`` runs the
``pygmentize`` program and the ``shell-escape`` option is required.

How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via ``doconce replace``. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code:


.. code-block:: py


        <%
        theorem_counter = 4
        %>
        
        # begin theorem
        label{theorem:fundamental1}
        <%
        theorem_counter += 1
        theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
        %>
        
        __Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        # end theorem
        
        # begin proof
        __Proof.__
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$|$END$
        # end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
        achievement.

The ``.p.tex`` output file now reads

.. code-block:: py


        % begin theorem
        label{theorem:fundamental1}
        
        
        \paragraph{Theorem 5.}
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        % end theorem
        
        % begin proof
        \paragraph{Proof.}
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$
        % end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
        achievement.

Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the ``% begin ...`` and ``% end ...`` lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the ``.p.tex`` file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with *Theorem*.
The following Bash script does the job:

.. code-block:: bash

        file=mydoc.p.tex
        thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
        doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
        doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
        doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
        doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file

More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
``mydoc.p.tex`` file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting ``mydoc.tex`` file now becomes

.. code-block:: py


        \usepackage{theorem}
        \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]
        
        ...
        
        \begin{theorem}
        \label{theorem:fundamental1}
        
        
        
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        \end{theorem}
        
        % begin proof
        \paragraph{Proof.}
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$
        % end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
        achievement.

Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the ``ptex2tex`` program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).


The LaTeX file does not compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving

.. code-block:: py


        \code{...}

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

Inline verbatim gives error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.,

.. code-block:: py


        some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
        ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
        then replace this by
        {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
        which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
        capture the second }

The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.

.. Could have doconce configure file where inline verbatim is

.. configured to be \fontsize... directly, not via ptex2tex \code{}.



Errors in figure captions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper ``texttt`` command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

Chapters are ignored
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run ``ptex2tex`` with the option ``-DBOOK`` to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:

1. Make a little Bash script that performs a series of
   ``doconce subst`` (regular expressions) or ``doconce replace`` (regular text)
   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to
   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).

2. Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate
   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then
   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This
   means that the ``doconce format latex`` command does not generate
   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these
   files.
   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro
   text and include the various text pieces in this file.
   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files
   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the
   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but
   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.

Problems with gwiki Output
--------------------------

Strange nested lists in gwiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the ``.gwiki`` file directly.

Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

Problems with HTML Output
-------------------------

How can I change the layout of the HTML page?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out ``TITLE:`` to get HTML without a header and footer). The
``--html-template=filename`` command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title (``%(title)s``),
a date (``%(date)s``), and the main body of text (``%(main)s``).
For typesetting code, ``pygments`` is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by ``--no-pygments-html`` (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the ``sphinx`` format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via ``doconce replace`` and
``doconce subst`` in the script that generates the final documents).

Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script:


.. code-block:: py


        doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
         '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
        doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
         '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html



Debugging
---------

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
``_doconce_debugging.log``, if the to ``doconce format`` after the filename
is ``debug``. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



Basic Parsing Ideas
===================

.. avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea)


The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression


.. code-block:: py


        (?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?


That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that ``argument``, ``keyword argument``, ``return``,
``instance variable``, ``class variable``, and ``module variable`` are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.


.. code-block:: py


            - argument x: x value (float),
              which must be a positive number.
            - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
              the iterations.
            - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
            - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
            - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
            - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
              (bool variable).


The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    :var x: 
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.

    :var tolerance: 
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

== What Is Doconce? ==

Doconce is two things:


 # Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,    emails). From reST you can (via `rst2*` programs) go to XML, HTML,    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via `unoconv`) to    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.
 # Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:


  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than    LaTeX and HTML.
  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code    directly from the source code files via regular expressions    for the start and end lines.
  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:


  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



== Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies ==

==== Doconce ====

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at http://code.google.com/p/doconce.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (`hg`) source follows the standard procedure:
{{{
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
{{{
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
{{{
sudo apt-get install doconce
}}}
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
{{{
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
}}}

==== Dependencies ====

==== Preprocessors ====

If you make use of the [http://code.google.com/p/preprocess Preprocess]
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

{{{
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
[http://www.makotemplates.org Mako]. Its installation is most
conveniently done by `pip`,

{{{
pip install Mako
}}}
This command requires `pip` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

{{{
sudo apt-get install python-pip
}}}
Alternatively, one can install from the `pip` [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip source code].

==== Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output ====

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need [http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex ptex2tex],
which is installed by

{{{
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
}}}
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, `cp2texmf.sh`:

{{{
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
}}}
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

{{{
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
}}}
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the `~/texmf/tex/latex/misc` directory).

Note that the `doconce ptex2tex` command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the `ptex2tex`
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by `ptex2tex` and `doconce ptext2tex`
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package [http://pygments.org Pygments]
to be installed:
{{{
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

If you use the minted style together with `ptex2tex`, you have to
enable it by the `-DMINTED` command-line argument to `ptex2tex`.  All
use of the minted style requires the `-shell-escape` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., `latex -shell-escape` or `pdflatex
-shell-escape`.

<wiki:comment> Say something about anslistings.sty </wiki:comment>

==== reStructuredText (reST) Output ====

The `rst` output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the [http://docutils.sourceforge.net docutils] package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

{{{
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
{{{
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
}}}

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
[http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf rst2pdf]. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the `rst2pdf` directory and
run the usual `sudo python setup.py install`.


Output to `sphinx` requires of course [http://sphinx.pocoo.org Sphinx],
installed by
{{{
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}

==== Markdown and Pandoc Output ====

The Doconce format `pandoc` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the `pandoc` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ Pandoc], written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

{{{
sudo apt-get install pandoc
}}}

==== Epydoc Output ====

When the output format is `epydoc` one needs that program too, installed
by
{{{
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
}}}

*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
`apt-get install` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For `svn` directories, go to the directory,
run `svn update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`. For
Mercurial (`hg`) directories, go to the directory, run
`hg pull; hg update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`.

<wiki:comment>  </wiki:comment>

==== Demos ====

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the
{{{
docs/manual/manual.do.txt
}}}
file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html demo web page]
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file `make.sh` in the same directory as the `manual.do.txt` file
(the current text) shows how to run `doconce format` on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in
{{{
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
}}}
In the `tutorial` directory there is also a `make.sh` file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html web demo]
of the results.

<wiki:comment> Example on including another Doconce file: </wiki:comment>



== From Doconce to Other Formats ==

Transformation of a Doconce document `mydoc.do.txt` to various other
formats applies the script `doconce format`:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
}}}
or just
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
}}}
The `mako` or `preprocess` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to `mako` or `preprocess` can be added after the
filename. For example,
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
}}}
The variable `FORMAT` is always defined as the current format when
running `preprocess`. That is, in the last example, `FORMAT` is
defined as `latex`. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like `#if FORMAT == "latex"`.

The command-line arguments `--no-preprocess` and `--no-mako` turn off
running `preprocess` and `mako`, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
}}}
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
{{{
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
}}}
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

==== HTML ====

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file `mydoc.do.txt`
is performed by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
}}}
The resulting file `mydoc.html` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the `pygmentize` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument `--no-pygments-html`
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain `<pre>` HTML tags. The option `--pygments-html-linenos` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": `%(title)s` for a title,
`%(date)s` for a date, and `%(main)s` for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
`DATE:` line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert `%(title)s` and
`%(date)s` at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by `%(main)s`. Here is an example:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
}}}

==== Pandoc and Markdown ====

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
{{{
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
}}}
The name of the output file is `mydoc.mkd`.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
{{{
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
}}}
Pandoc supports `latex`, `html`, `odt` (OpenOffice), `docx` (Microsoft
Word), `rtf`, `texinfo`, to mention some. The `-R` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the `--toc` option generates a table of contents.
See the [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html Pandoc documentation]
for the many features of the `pandoc` program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
`doconce format pandoc` and then translating using `pandoc`, or
`doconce format latex`, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using `pandoc`.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
}}}
When we go through `pandoc`, only single equations or `align*`
environments are well understood.

Quite some `doconce replace` and `doconce subst` edits might be needed
on the `.mkd` or `.tex` files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
}}}
The `-s` option adds a proper header and footer to the `mydoc.html` file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

==== LaTeX ====

Making a LaTeX file `mydoc.tex` from `mydoc.do.txt` is done in two steps:
<wiki:comment> Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> environment, as used here. </wiki:comment>

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form `mydoc.p.tex` for
the `ptex2tex` program (or `doconce ptex2tex`):
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
}}}
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files `newcommands.tex`, `newcommands_keep.tex`, or
`newcommands_replace.tex` (see the section [#Macros_(Newcommands)]).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run `ptex2tex` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
}}}
In case you do not have `ptex2tex`, you may run a (very) simplified version:
{{{
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
}}}

Note that Doconce generates a `.p.tex` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
}}}
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through `-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional`.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
`-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage`.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are


 * `BOOK` for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 * `PALATINO` for the Palatino font
 * `HELVETIA` for the Helvetica font
 * `A4PAPER` for A4 paper size
 * `A6PAPER` for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 * `MOVIE15` for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 * `PREAMBLE` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document   or document to be included elsewhere)
 * `MINTED` for inclusion of the minted package (which requires `latex`   or `pdflatex` to be run with the `-shell-escape` option)

The `ptex2tex` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any `!bc` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your `.ptex2tex.cfg`
file, e.g., `!bc sys` for a terminal session, where `sys` is set to
a certain environment in `.ptex2tex.cfg` (e.g., `CodeTerminal`).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the `doconce ptex2tex` command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the `.p.tex` file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
{{{
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
}}}
Note that `@` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as `minted`
above, which implies `\begin{minted}{fortran}` and `\end{minted}` as
begin and end for blocks inside `!bc fpro` and `!ec`).  Specifying
`envir=ans:nt` means that all other environments are typeset with the
`anslistings.sty` package, e.g., `!bc cppcod` will then result in
`\begin{c++}`. If no environments like `sys`, `fpro`, or the common
`envir` are defined on the command line, the plain `\begin{verbatim}`
and `\end{verbatim}` used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the `mydoc.tex` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute `section` by `section*` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst`
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
{{{
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
}}}
A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile `mydoc.tex`
and create the PDF file:
{{{
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}

If one wishes to run `ptex2tex` and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (`Minted_Python`, `Minted_Cpp`, etc., in
`ptex2tex` specified through the `*pro` and `*cod` variables in
`.ptex2tex.cfg` or `$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg`), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running `ptex2tex` with the
`-DMINTED` option:
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
}}}
In this case, `latex` must be run with the
`-shell-escape` option:
{{{
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}
When running `doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted` (or other minted
specifications with `doconce ptex2tex`), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the `-DMINTED` option.

==== PDFLaTeX ====

Running `pdflatex` instead of `latex` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
}}}
Then `ptex2tex` is run as explained above, and finally
{{{
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
}}}

==== Plain ASCII Text ====

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
}}}

==== reStructuredText ====

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file `mydoc.rst`:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
}}}
We may now produce various other formats:
{{{
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
}}}

The OpenOffice file `mydoc.odt` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program `unovonv`
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run
{{{
Terminal> unoconv --show
}}}
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
`mydoc.odt` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
{{{
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
}}}

*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by `latex` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the `sphinx` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.


 * http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1033441
 * http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/textopc.html
 * http://nileshbansal.blogspot.com/2007/12/latex-to-openofficeword.html

==== Sphinx ====

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the `doconce sphinx_dir` command:
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
}}}
The keywords `author`, `title`, and `version` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, `version` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files `file1`,
`file2`, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files `file1`, `file2`, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of `dirname` is `sphinx-rootdir`. The `theme`
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is `'default'`).

With a single-file document in `mydoc.do.txt` one often just runs
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
}}}
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory `sphinx-rootdir` is made with
relevant files.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` command generates a script
`automake_sphinx.py` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run `automake_sphinx.py` or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` script copies directories named `figs` or
`figures` over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, `automake_sphinx.py` must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not `http:` or `file:` URLs), must be
placed in the `_static` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility `doconce sphinxfix_localURLs` is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say `dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` it
replaces the link by `_static/myfile.txt` and copies
`dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` to a local `_static` directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in `_static` or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all `_static/*` files to the
`_static` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a `_static` or `_static-name` directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the `conf.py`
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
`make-themes.sh` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes `fenics` and `pyramid`, one writes
{{{
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
}}}
The resulting directories with HTML documents are `_build/html_fenics`
and `_build/html_pyramid`, respectively. Without arguments,
`make-themes.sh` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file `mydoc.do.txt`.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
}}}

*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive `sphinx-quickstart`
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
{{{
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
}}}
The autogenerated `conf.py` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The `doconce sphinx_dir` generator makes an extended `conv.py`
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the `mydoc.rst` file to the Sphinx root directory:
{{{
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
}}}
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with `mydoc.rst` in the `sphinx-rootdir`
directory. Either edit `mydoc.rst` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to `sphinx-rootdir`.
Links to local files in `mydoc.rst` must be modified to links to
files in the `_static` directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated `index.rst` file so that `mydoc.rst`
is included, i.e., add `mydoc` to the `toctree` section so that it becomes
{{{
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
}}}
(The spaces before `mydoc` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
{{{
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
}}}

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with `index.html` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result:
{{{
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
}}}

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows `!bc`: `cod` gives Python
(`code-block:: python` in Sphinx syntax) and `cppcod` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

==== Wiki Formats ====

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
[http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax Googlecode wiki], MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
`gwiki`, `mwiki`, and `cwiki`, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
}}}

The Googlecode wiki document, `mydoc.gwiki`, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the `.gwiki` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of [http://pediapress.com/code/ mwlib]. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write [http://en.wikibooks.org Wikibooks]
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.

==== Tweaking the Doconce Output ====

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
`.rst` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if `.eps` or `.png` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The `make.sh` files in `docs/manual` and `docs/tutorial`
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



== The Doconce Markup Language ==

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

==== Lists ====

An unordered bullet list makes use of the `*` as bullet sign
and is indented as follows

{{{
   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3
}}}

This list gets typeset as


   * item 1
   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more       lines, each line must       be intended as shown here
     * subitem 2,       also spans two lines


   * item 3

(As seen, nested lists in (g)wiki format are not treated well by
Doconce. Plain unnested lists work fine. And the (g)wiki format
automatically puts multiple lines of an item on a single line as
required :-)

In an ordered list, each item starts with an `o` (as the first letter
in "ordered"):

{{{
   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3
}}}

resulting in


  # item 1
  # item 2

     * subitem 1
     * subitem 2


  # item 3

(Again, there are problems with mixing nested lists and liststypes
for the (g)wiki format.)

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:

{{{
   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)
}}}

The result becomes


   * keyword1:  
     explanation of keyword1
   * keyword2:  
     explanation     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly     if there are multiple     lines)

==== Special Lines ====

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with `TITLE:`, `AUTHOR:`, and `DATE:` are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax
{{{
name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3
}}}
The `at` with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the `and` with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax
{{{
name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2
}}}
Multiple authors require multiple `AUTHOR:` lines. All information
associated with `TITLE:` and `AUTHOR:` keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:
{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: November 9, 2016
}}}
Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including `rst` and `sphinx`)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:
{{{
Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
A. Dummy Author

[1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
[2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
[3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
}}}
Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as `today`.


*Table of Contents.* A table of contents can be generated by the line
{{{
TOC: on
}}}
This line is usually placed after the `DATE:` line.
A value `off` turns off the table of contents.


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):


   * 9 `=` characters for chapters
   * 7 for sections
   * 5 for subsections
   * 3 for subsubsections
   * 2 *underscrores* (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
*must* be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples:
{{{
__Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
various section headings.

========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========

Some text.


======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.


===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====

The running text goes here.

===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.
}}}



== Special Lines ==

==== Figures ====

<wiki:comment> Note: need extra blank after FIGURE and MOVIE in !bc environments </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> because doconce treats !ec as part of the caption and moves the </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> !ec up to the caption line </wiki:comment>

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax
{{{
FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

}}}
The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say `.eps` when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's `convert` utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for `TITLE:` and `AUTHOR:` lines, all information
related to a figure line *must be written on the same line*. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as `FIGURE:` will be
included in the formatted caption).



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure:  Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. (fig:viz)

https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/manual/figs/streamtubes.png

<wiki:comment>
Put the figure file figs/streamtubes.png on the web (e.g., as part of the
googlecode repository) and substitute the line above with the URL.
</wiki:comment>
---------------------------------------------------------------



Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
`montage` program from the ImageMagick suite:
{{{
montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
        file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png
}}}
The option `-tile XxY` gives `X` figures in the horizontal direction and
`Y` in the vertical direction (`tile 2x` means two figures per row
and `-tile x2` means two rows).

==== Movies ====

Here is an example on the `MOVIE:` keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the `latex`, `html`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.
{{{
MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption

}}}

<wiki:comment> latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies, </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> or just plain \hrun: ...{...} </wiki:comment>

 (Movie figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play mjolnir.html)

<wiki:comment> MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470] </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470] </wiki:comment>

The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the `movie15` package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable `MOVIE15`. There is an associated variable
`EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER` which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc
}}}

The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
`myframes*.png`. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the `MOVIE:` command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).

==== Copying Computer Code from Source Files ====

Another type of special lines starts with `@@@CODE` and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section [#Blocks_of_Verbatim_Computer_Code] below.

==== Inline Tagging ====

Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, *boldface phrases*,
and `verbatim text` (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as `v = sin(x)`.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in
{{{
*emphasized words*
}}}

Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:
{{{
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.
}}}
The line above gets typeset as
*several words in boldface* followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks:
{{{
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.
}}}
The typesetting result looks like this:
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and `ptex2tex`) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as
{{{
some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
}}}
which appears as some URL like [http://google.com Search Google].
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in `.txt`, `.html`, `.pdf`, `.py`, `.f`,
`.f77`, `.f90`, `.f95`, `.sh`, `.csh`, `.ksh`, `.zsh`,
`.c`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.pl`, and `.java` follows the same
setup:
{{{
see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".
}}}
which appears as see the [manual.do.txt Doconce Manual].
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:


  * In the `html` format the links work well if the files are    supplied with the `.html` with the same relative location.
  * In the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats, such links in PDF files    will unless the `.tex` file has a full URL specified through    a `\hyperbaseurl` command and the linked files are located correctly    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.
  * In the `sphinx` format, local files to which there are links should only be    located in a `_static` or `_static-name` subdirectory.

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a `_static` or `_static-name` directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (`name` is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the `html` format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
`pygmentize`, e.g.,
{{{
Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
          -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh
}}}
Then you can link to `_static/make.sh.html` instead of
`subdir/make.sh`. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as `src/myprog.py` in her
software and the document links to `_static/myprog.py`:
{{{
See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").
}}}

Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
*the filename as link text*. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:
{{{
URL: "manual.html"
}}}
resulting in the link manual.html.

<wiki:comment> This is now automatically carried out by the autogenerated </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> script for sphinx: </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> For such local links to </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> work with the `sphinx` format, the `.rst` file needs a fix, carried </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> out by </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> !bc sys </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> doconce sphinxfix_localURLs mydoc.rst </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> !ec </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> (The files, such as `manual.html`, are then copied to a subdirectory </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> `_static`, which must be manually copied to the Sphinx directory's </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> `_static` directory - links in the `.rst` files are automatically </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> adjusted.) </wiki:comment>

Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:
{{{
Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".
}}}
resulting in Click on this link: http://code.google.com/p/doconce.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:
{{{
[name: comment]
}}}
where `name` is the name of the author of the command, and `comment` is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless `doconce format`
is run with a command-line argument `--skip_inline_comments`
(see the chapter [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats] for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the `.do.txt` file
(see the chapter [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats]).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII:

{{{
Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.
}}}
That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (`latex`, `pdflatex`, `html`,
`sphinx`, `mwiki`), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system `Ax=b`, where `A`
is an `nxn` matrix, and `x` and `b`
are vectors of length `n`."

==== Comments ====

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as *inline comments* in Doconce and described
in the section [#Inline_Tagging].

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash `#`:
{{{
#
# Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
# These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
#
}}}
Such comment lines may have some side effects in the `rst` and `sphinx`
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out *before*
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash `##` and lines enclosed by
the `<%doc>` (beginning) and `<%doc/>` (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.

==== Cross-Referencing ====

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:
{{{
label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.
}}}
This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
`rst` and `sphinx` formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by `doconce format`. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure fig:viz
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections [#LaTeX_Blocks_of_Mathematical_Text] and [#Macros_(Newcommands)] are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section [#Inline_Tagging].

==== Index and Bibliography ====

An index can be created for the `latex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats
by the `idx` keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:
{{{
idx{some index entry}
idx{main entry!subentry}
idx{`verbatim_text` and more}
}}}
The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to
{{{
\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}
}}}
Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: `idx`
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:
{{{
as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.
}}}
Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding `cite` command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like
{{{
as found in [3][14]
}}}
if `Larsen_1986` has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and `Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999` is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword `BIBFILE:`,
followed by a BibTeX file with extension `.bib`,
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension `.rst`,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension `.py`.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,
{{{
{
'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
""",
'Larsen_1986':
"""
O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
*Personal Press*. 1986.
"""
}
}}}

In the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats, the `.bib` file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the `rst` and `sphinx` formats, the
`.rst` file will be copied into the document at the place where the
`BIBFILE:` keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the `BIBFILE:` line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is `myfile.bib`.
Insert `BIBFILE: myfile.bib` at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the `.rst` file, either by manual editing
of `myfile.bbl` or using `doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl` to automate (most of)
this editing. From the `myfile.rst` file it is easy to create `myfile.py`
with the dictionary version of the references.

<wiki:comment> see ketch/tex2rst for nice bibtex to rst converter which could </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> be used here </wiki:comment>

Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/ bibliograph.parsing] tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [1], a paper [2],
and both of them simultaneously [1] [2].

[somereader: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) ]

==== Tables ====

A table like


 ||      *time*       ||    *velocity*     ||  *acceleration*   ||
 ||  0.0              ||  1.4186           ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  2.0              ||  1.376512         ||  11.919           ||
 ||  4.0              ||  1.1E+1           ||  14.717624        ||


is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:
{{{
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
}}}
The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters `c`, `r`, or `l` to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes `|` can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (`rst` and `sphinx` are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.

==== Exercises, Problems, or Projects ====

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
*exercise*, *problem*, or *project*.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 `=` characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this:
{{{
===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{proj:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf
solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt

Here goes the running text of the project....

}}}
Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project *title*,
the *label*, the *result file*, the *solution* (if any of
these three entities is present), and the *running text*. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with `!bsubex` and ending
with `!esubex`, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) *answer*, and *hints*. The environments have begin-end
directives `!bans`, `!eans`, `!bsol`, `!esol`, `!bhint`, `!ehint`, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
`!bc` and `!ec`).

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the `solution=...` directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows:
{{{
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf

Here goes the running text of the project....

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
}}}

The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file `.mydoc.exerinfo`,
if `mydoc.do.txt` is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The *title* is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem ..."
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".

==== Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code ====

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" `!bc` keyword and an "end code" `!ec` keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the `!bc` tag to specify a
certain environment (for `ptex2tex` or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, `!bc dat` corresponds to
the data file environment and `!bc cod` is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for `ptex2tex` this means the `ccq` environment,
which is defined in the config file `.ptex2tex.cfg`,
while for Sphinx it defaults to the `python` environment).

Since the config file for `ptex2tex` can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after `!bc` is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.,
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
Here, three arguments are defined: `pycod` for Python code,
`cod` also for Python code, `cppcod` for C++ code, and `sys`
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in `.ptex2tex.cfg` for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, `pro` is used for complete programs in Python, `cod` is
for a code snippet in Python, while `xcod` and `xpro` implies computer
language specific typesetting where `x` can be `f` for Fortran, `c`
for C, `cpp` for C++, `sh` for Unix shells, `pl` for Perl, `m` for
Matlab, `cy` for Cython, and `py` for Python.  The argument `sys`
means by default `console` for Sphinx and `CodeTerminal` (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are `dat` for a data file
or print out, and `ipy` for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in `sphinx` output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after `!bc` can be redefined in the
`.ptex2tex.cfg` configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
`sphinx code-blocks` comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.

<wiki:comment> (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> first one is used.) </wiki:comment>

The enclosing `!ec` tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (`pycod` style):
{{{
# regular expressions for inline tags:
inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
INLINE_TAGS = {
    'emphasize':
    r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'verbatim':
    r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'bold':
    r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
}
}}}
And here is a C++ code snippet (`cppcod` style):
{{{
void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
        myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
    }
}
}}}

<wiki:comment> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... </wiki:comment>
Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then
{{{
 @@@CODE myfile.f
 @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1
}}}
The first line implies that all lines in the file `myfile.f` are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a `!bc Xpro` environment, where
`X` is the extension of the filename, here `f` (i.e., the environment
becomes `!bc fpro` and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a `fromto:` directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, `X` is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the `pro` and `cod` arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain `!bc` environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
`@` sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching `subroutine test`
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching `C END1` (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):

{{{
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}

Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the `fromto:`
directive above:

{{{
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
}}}

Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing `fromto:` by
`from-to` ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text
{{{
# --- Start Example 1 ---
c = -1
A = 2
p0 = 4
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 1 ---

# --- Start Example 2 ---
c = -1
A = 1
p0 = 0
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 2 ---
}}}
is easy with
{{{
from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2
}}}
With only `fromto:` this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with `ptex2tex`: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in `ptex2tex`. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
`.p.tex` file to be treated by `ptex2tex`. However, the `@@@CODE` line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the `ptex2tex` configuration
file.)

==== LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text ====

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is `!bt` (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
`!et`. It is important that `!bt` and `!et` appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.
{{{
{{{
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
}}}
}}}
Here is the result of the above `!bt` - `!et` block:
{{{
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
}}}

The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
`latex` and `pdflatex` has of course full support. The `html` format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although `sphinx`, like `html`, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
(`pandoc` format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the `latex` format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After `#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")` one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
`#else` one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.

==== Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice ====

If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.


 # Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.
 # Go to the Sphinx directory and load the `conf.py` file into    a browser.
 # Search for "math" and comment out the    `'sphinx.ext.mathjax'` (enabled by default) and    `'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'` (disabled by default)    lines, and uncomment the `'sphinx.ext.pngmath'` package.    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures    of the mathematics.
 # Uncomment the line with `pngmath_dvipng_args =` and    set the PNG resolution to `-D 200` when the purpose is to    generate mathematics pictures for slides.
 # Run `make html`.
 # Look at the HTML source file in the `_build/html`    directory: all mathematics are in `img` tags with `src=`    pointing to a PNG file and `alt=` pointing to the LaTeX    source for the formula in question. This makes it very    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular    mathematical expression.

==== Macros (Newcommands) ====

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
`newcommand_replace.tex`:

{{{
\newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
\newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
\newcommand{\Q}{\pmb{Q}}
}}}

and these in `newcommands_keep.tex`:

{{{
\newcommand{\x}{\pmb{x}}
\newcommand{\normalvec}{\pmb{n}}
\newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}
}}}

The LaTeX block
{{{
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
}}}
will then be rendered to
{{{
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
}}}
in the current format.

==== Preprocessing Steps ====

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(http://code.google.com/p/preprocess) and mako
(http://www.makotemplates.org/). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of `name=value` command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable `FORMAT`
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (`html`, `latex`,
`plain`, `rst`, `sphinx`, `epydoc`, `st`).  It is then easy to test on
the value of `FORMAT` and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example:

{{{
# If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
# PostScript files are used.

# #if FORMAT == "latex"
# Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
\begin{figure}
label{fig:wavepackets}
  \begin{center}
#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
#  #endif

#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
#  #endif
  \end{center}
  \caption{
  Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
  }
\end{figure}

# #else

# Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.

# #endif
}}}

Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats].

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.

==== Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces ====

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form `#include "file.do.txt"`.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate `.rst` files and an index file listing the various `.rst`
that build up the document. To generate the various `.rst` files one
should not run Doconce on the individual `.do.txt` files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script `doconce split_rst`
to split the long, complete `.rst` into pieces. This process requires
that each `#include "file.do.txt` line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax `#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>`, where
`file` is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword `part:`.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is `master.do.txt`.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run
{{{
doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake_sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi
}}}
The autogenerated `automake_sphinx.sh` file (by `doconce sphinx_dir`)
is compatible with a master `.rst` file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to `doconce sphinx_dir`.
This set is the output of `doconce split_rst`, which we catch in a
variable `files` above.

==== Missing Features ====

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line

{{{
# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
# insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
# #else
# insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
# #endif
}}}

Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say
{{{
# table of contents
}}}
we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce `doconce format latex mydoc` to produce `mydoc.p.tex`. Then
we use the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst` commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:
{{{
Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
}}}
The `doconce replace from_text to_text filename` command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the `replace` method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with `\tableofcontents`, we should use `doconce subst`,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:
{{{
Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
}}}
Note the double backshlash in front of the `t` character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The `doconce subst` is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

==== Header and Footer ====

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if `TITLE:` or
`#TITLE:` is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.

==== Emacs Doconce Formatter ====

The file `misc/.doconce-mode.el` in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

*Step 1.* Download the Doconce tarball from `code.google.com/p/doconce`,
pack it out and go to the root directory.

*Step 2.* Copy the `doconce-mode.el` file to the home directory:
{{{
cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME
}}}

*Step 3.* Add these lines to `$HOME/.emacs`:
{{{
(load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
(setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))
}}}
Emacs will now recognize files with extension `.do.txt` and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.



== Troubleshooting ==

==== Disclaimer ====

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running `doconce format`, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.

==== General Problems ====

==== Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step ====

Doconce automatically removes the file `__tmp.do.txt`, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when `mako` and/or
`preprocess` is run). Add the `--debug` flag at the end of the
`doconce` command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
`__tmp.do.txt` is deleted.

==== Figure captions are incomplete ====

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

==== Preprocessor directives do not work ====

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

==== Problems with boldface and emphasize ====

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

==== Links to local directories do not work ====

Links of the type
{{{
see the "examples directory": "src/examples"
}}}
do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file:
{{{
see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"
}}}

==== Links are not typeset correctly ====

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim:
{{{
see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".
}}}
However, the following will not be typeset correctly:
{{{
see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"
}}}
The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.

==== Inline verbatim code is not detected ====

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

==== Strange non-English characters ====

Check the encoding of the `.do.txt` file with the Unix `file` command
or with
{{{
Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
}}}
If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands
{{{
Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt

Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
}}}

==== Wrong Norwegian charcters ====

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run `doconce change_encoding` to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

==== Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly ====

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

==== Too short underlining of reST headlines ====

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.

==== Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG) ====

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first `!bt` (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

==== Problems with code or Tex Blocks ====

==== Code or math block errors in reST ====

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a `!bc`, which should have been removed when
running `doconce format sphinx`, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then `!bc` will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

==== Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST ====

If `idx` commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

==== Something is wrong with a verbatim code block ====

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

==== Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format ====

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before `!bt` and `!bc` environments.

==== Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly ====

Read the the section [#Blocks_of_Verbatim_Computer_Code] above.  Start the
`!bc` and `!ec` tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

==== LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly ====

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the `!bt` and `!et` tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.

==== Problems with reST/Sphinx Output ====

==== Lists do not appear in .rst files ====

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

==== Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST ====

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

==== Warning about duplicate link names ====

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

==== Inconsistent headings in reST ====

The `rst2*.py` and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for `===`,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

==== No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks ====

The `!bc ipy` directive behaves this way for `sphinx` output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to `!bc cod` or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

==== Problems with LaTeX Output ====

==== Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed ====

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the `-shell-escape` command-line argument when
running `latex` or `pdflatex`:
{{{
Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
}}}
Using `doconce ptex2tex` will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using `ptex2tex` requires the
preprocessor option `-DMINTED` to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, `latex` or `pdflatex` runs the
`pygmentize` program and the `shell-escape` option is required.

==== How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments? ====

Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via `doconce replace`. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code:

{{{
<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.
}}}
The `.p.tex` output file now reads
{{{
% begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
}}}
Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the `% begin ...` and `% end ...` lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the `.p.tex` file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with *Theorem*.
The following Bash script does the job:
{{{
file=mydoc.p.tex
thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file
}}}
More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
`mydoc.p.tex` file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting `mydoc.tex` file now becomes
{{{
\usepackage{theorem}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]

...

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
}}}
Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the `ptex2tex` program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).

==== The LaTeX file does not compile ====

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
{{{
\code{...}
}}}
the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

==== Inline verbatim gives error ====

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.,
{{{
some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
then replace this by
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
capture the second }
}}}
The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.

<wiki:comment> Could have doconce configure file where inline verbatim is </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> configured to be \fontsize... directly, not via ptex2tex \code{}. </wiki:comment>

==== Errors in figure captions ====

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper `texttt` command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

==== Chapters are ignored ====

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run `ptex2tex` with the option `-DBOOK` to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

==== I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file ====

The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:


# Make a little Bash script that performs a series of   `doconce subst` (regular expressions) or `doconce replace` (regular text)   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).
# Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This   means that the `doconce format latex` command does not generate   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these   files.   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro   text and include the various text pieces in this file.   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.

==== Problems with gwiki Output ====

==== Strange nested lists in gwiki ====

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the `.gwiki` file directly.

==== Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source ====

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

==== Problems with HTML Output ====

==== How can I change the layout of the HTML page? ====

The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out `TITLE:` to get HTML without a header and footer). The
`--html-template=filename` command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title (`%(title)s`),
a date (`%(date)s`), and the main body of text (`%(main)s`).
For typesetting code, `pygments` is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by `--no-pygments-html` (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the `sphinx` format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via `doconce replace` and
`doconce subst` in the script that generates the final documents).

==== Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates? ====

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script:

{{{
doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
 '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
 '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html
}}}

==== Debugging ====

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
`_doconce_debugging.log`, if the to `doconce format` after the filename
is `debug`. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



== Basic Parsing Ideas ==

<wiki:comment> avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea) </wiki:comment>

The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression

{{{
(?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?
}}}

That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.

==== Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables ====

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that `argument`, `keyword argument`, `return`,
`instance variable`, `class variable`, and `module variable` are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.

{{{
    - argument x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
    - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
    - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
    - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
    - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
      (bool variable).
}}}

The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.


    * *module variable* x:  
      x value (float),      which must be a positive number.
    * *module variable* tolerance:  
      tolerance (float) for stopping      the iterations.

== What Is Doconce? ==

Doconce is two things:


<ol>
 <li> Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,    emails). From reST you can (via <code>rst2*</code> programs) go to XML, HTML,    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via <code>unoconv</code>) to    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats. <li> Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".</ol>

Here are some Doconce features:


<ul>
  <li> Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than    LaTeX and HTML.  <li> Doconce can be converted to plain ''untagged'' text,    often desirable for computer programs and email.  <li> Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code    directly from the source code files via regular expressions    for the start and end lines.  <li> Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well    with big LaTeX projects (books).  <li> Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.  <li> Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming    construction for generating parts of the text.</ul>

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:


<ul>
  <li> Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.  <li> Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.  <li> Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.</ul>

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



== Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies ==

==== Doconce ====

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at http://code.google.com/p/doconce.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (<code>hg</code>) source follows the standard procedure:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</code>
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
</code>

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo apt-get install doconce
</code>
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
</code>

==== Dependencies ====

==== Preprocessors ====

If you make use of the [http://code.google.com/p/preprocess Preprocess]
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</code>

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
[http://www.makotemplates.org Mako]. Its installation is most
conveniently done by <code>pip</code>,

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
pip install Mako
</code>
This command requires <code>pip</code> to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo apt-get install python-pip
</code>
Alternatively, one can install from the <code>pip</code> [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip source code].

==== Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output ====

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need [http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex ptex2tex],
which is installed by

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
</code>
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, <code>cp2texmf.sh</code>:

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
</code>
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that <code>ptex2tex</code> potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
</code>
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the <code>~/texmf/tex/latex/misc</code> directory).

Note that the <code>doconce ptex2tex</code> command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the <code>ptex2tex</code>
program.

The ''minted'' LaTeX style is offered by <code>ptex2tex</code> and <code>doconce ptext2tex</code>
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package [http://pygments.org Pygments]
to be installed:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
</code>

If you use the minted style together with <code>ptex2tex</code>, you have to
enable it by the <code>-DMINTED</code> command-line argument to <code>ptex2tex</code>.  All
use of the minted style requires the <code>-shell-escape</code> command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., <code>latex -shell-escape</code> or <code>pdflatex
-shell-escape</code>.

<!--> Say something about anslistings.sty -->

==== reStructuredText (reST) Output ====

The <code>rst</code> output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the [http://docutils.sourceforge.net docutils] package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</code>
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
</code>

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
[http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf rst2pdf]. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the <code>rst2pdf</code> directory and
run the usual <code>sudo python setup.py install</code>.


Output to <code>sphinx</code> requires of course [http://sphinx.pocoo.org Sphinx],
installed by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
</code>

==== Markdown and Pandoc Output ====

The Doconce format <code>pandoc</code> outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the <code>pandoc</code> program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ Pandoc], written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
sudo apt-get install pandoc
</code>

==== Epydoc Output ====

When the output format is <code>epydoc</code> one needs that program too, installed
by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
</code>

''Remark.'' Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
<code>apt-get install</code> command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For <code>svn</code> directories, go to the directory,
run <code>svn update</code>, and then <code>sudo python setup.py install</code>. For
Mercurial (<code>hg</code>) directories, go to the directory, run
<code>hg pull; hg update</code>, and then <code>sudo python setup.py install</code>.


<!-->  -->
<!--> Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting -->
<!--> these lines are converted to comments in the output format. -->
<!--> This may have some side effects, especially in rst and sphinx -->
<!--> where lines following the comment may be taken as part of -->

<!--> ''before'' doconce sees the text. That can be useful when -->
<!--> doconce comments interferes with formatting. -->
<!--> The mako tool also supports <%doc> .. </%doc> -->
<!-->  -->

==== Demos ====

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
docs/manual/manual.do.txt
</code>
file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html demo web page]
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file <code>make.sh</code> in the same directory as the <code>manual.do.txt</code> file
(the current text) shows how to run <code>doconce format</code> on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
</code>
In the <code>tutorial</code> directory there is also a <code>make.sh</code> file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html web demo]
of the results.

== From Doconce to Other Formats ==

Transformation of a Doconce document <code>mydoc.do.txt</code> to various other
formats applies the script <code>doconce format</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
</code>
or just
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
</code>
The <code>mako</code> or <code>preprocess</code> programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to <code>mako</code> or <code>preprocess</code> can be added after the
filename. For example,
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
</code>
The variable <code>FORMAT</code> is always defined as the current format when
running <code>preprocess</code>. That is, in the last example, <code>FORMAT</code> is
defined as <code>latex</code>. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like <code>#if FORMAT == "latex"</code>.

The command-line arguments <code>--no-preprocess</code> and <code>--no-mako</code> turn off
running <code>preprocess</code> and <code>mako</code>, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
</code>
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
<code>
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
</code>
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

==== HTML ====

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file <code>mydoc.do.txt</code>
is performed by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
</code>
The resulting file <code>mydoc.html</code> can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the <code>pygmentize</code> program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument <code>--no-pygments-html</code>
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain <code><pre></code> HTML tags. The option <code>--pygments-html-linenos</code> turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": <code>%(title)s</code> for a title,
<code>%(date)s</code> for a date, and <code>%(main)s</code> for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
<code>DATE:</code> line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert <code>%(title)s</code> and
<code>%(date)s</code> at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by <code>%(main)s</code>. Here is an example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
</code>

==== Pandoc and Markdown ====

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
</code>
The name of the output file is <code>mydoc.mkd</code>.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
</code>
Pandoc supports <code>latex</code>, <code>html</code>, <code>odt</code> (OpenOffice), <code>docx</code> (Microsoft
Word), <code>rtf</code>, <code>texinfo</code>, to mention some. The <code>-R</code> option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the <code>--toc</code> option generates a table of contents.
See the [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html Pandoc documentation]
for the many features of the <code>pandoc</code> program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
<code>doconce format pandoc</code> and then translating using <code>pandoc</code>, or
<code>doconce format latex</code>, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using <code>pandoc</code>.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
</code>
When we go through <code>pandoc</code>, only single equations or <code>align*</code>
environments are well understood.

Quite some <code>doconce replace</code> and <code>doconce subst</code> edits might be needed
on the <code>.mkd</code> or <code>.tex</code> files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
</code>
The <code>-s</code> option adds a proper header and footer to the <code>mydoc.html</code> file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

==== LaTeX ====

Making a LaTeX file <code>mydoc.tex</code> from <code>mydoc.do.txt</code> is done in two steps:
<!--> Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many -->
<!--> formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph -->
<!--> environment, as used here. -->

''Step 1.'' Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form <code>mydoc.p.tex</code> for
the <code>ptex2tex</code> program (or <code>doconce ptex2tex</code>):
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
</code>
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files <code>newcommands.tex</code>, <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code>, or
<code>newcommands_replace.tex</code> (see the section [#Macros_(Newcommands)]).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

''Step 2.'' Run <code>ptex2tex</code> (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
</code>
In case you do not have <code>ptex2tex</code>, you may run a (very) simplified version:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
</code>

Note that Doconce generates a <code>.p.tex</code> file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
</code>
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through <code>-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional</code>.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
<code>-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage</code>.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are


<ul>
 <li> <code>BOOK</code> for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings) <li> <code>PALATINO</code> for the Palatino font <li> <code>HELVETIA</code> for the Helvetica font <li> <code>A4PAPER</code> for A4 paper size <li> <code>A6PAPER</code> for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices) <li> <code>MOVIE15</code> for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies <li> <code>PREAMBLE</code> to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document   or document to be included elsewhere) <li> <code>MINTED</code> for inclusion of the minted package (which requires <code>latex</code>   or <code>pdflatex</code> to be run with the <code>-shell-escape</code> option)</ul>

The <code>ptex2tex</code> tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any <code>!bc</code> command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your <code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code>
file, e.g., <code>!bc sys</code> for a terminal session, where <code>sys</code> is set to
a certain environment in <code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code> (e.g., <code>CodeTerminal</code>).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the <code>doconce ptex2tex</code> command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the <code>.p.tex</code> file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
</code>
Note that <code>@</code> must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as <code>minted</code>
above, which implies <code>\begin{minted}{fortran}</code> and <code>\end{minted}</code> as
begin and end for blocks inside <code>!bc fpro</code> and <code>!ec</code>).  Specifying
<code>envir=ans:nt</code> means that all other environments are typeset with the
<code>anslistings.sty</code> package, e.g., <code>!bc cppcod</code> will then result in
<code>\begin{c++}</code>. If no environments like <code>sys</code>, <code>fpro</code>, or the common
<code>envir</code> are defined on the command line, the plain <code>\begin{verbatim}</code>
and <code>\end{verbatim}</code> used.


''Step 2b (optional).'' Edit the <code>mydoc.tex</code> file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute <code>section</code> by <code>section*</code> to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the <code>doconce replace</code> and <code>doconce subst</code>
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
</code>
A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

''Step 3.'' Compile <code>mydoc.tex</code>
and create the PDF file:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
</code>

If one wishes to run <code>ptex2tex</code> and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (<code>Minted_Python</code>, <code>Minted_Cpp</code>, etc., in
<code>ptex2tex</code> specified through the <code>*pro</code> and <code>*cod</code> variables in
<code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code> or <code>$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg</code>), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running <code>ptex2tex</code> with the
<code>-DMINTED</code> option:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
</code>
In this case, <code>latex</code> must be run with the
<code>-shell-escape</code> option:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
</code>
When running <code>doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted</code> (or other minted
specifications with <code>doconce ptex2tex</code>), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the <code>-DMINTED</code> option.

==== PDFLaTeX ====

Running <code>pdflatex</code> instead of <code>latex</code> follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
</code>
Then <code>ptex2tex</code> is run as explained above, and finally
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
</code>

==== Plain ASCII Text ====

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
</code>

==== reStructuredText ====

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file <code>mydoc.rst</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
</code>
We may now produce various other formats:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
</code>

The OpenOffice file <code>mydoc.odt</code> can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program <code>unovonv</code>
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports ''on the command line''.
Run
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> unoconv --show
</code>
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
<code>mydoc.odt</code> to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
</code>

''Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.'' At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by <code>latex</code> as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the <code>sphinx</code> output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.


<ul>
 <li> [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1033441  li] http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/textopc.html <li> [http://nileshbansal.blogspot.com/2007/12/latex-to-openofficeword.html /ul]

==== Sphinx ====

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the <code>doconce sphinx_dir</code> command:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
</code>
The keywords <code>author</code>, <code>title</code>, and <code>version</code> are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, <code>version</code> is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files <code>file1</code>,
<code>file2</code>, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files <code>file1</code>, <code>file2</code>, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of <code>dirname</code> is <code>sphinx-rootdir</code>. The <code>theme</code>
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is <code>'default'</code>).

With a single-file document in <code>mydoc.do.txt</code> one often just runs
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
</code>
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory <code>sphinx-rootdir</code> is made with
relevant files.

The <code>doconce sphinx_dir</code> command generates a script
<code>automake_sphinx.py</code> for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run <code>automake_sphinx.py</code> or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The <code>doconce sphinx_dir</code> script copies directories named <code>figs</code> or
<code>figures</code> over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, <code>automake_sphinx.py</code> must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not <code>http:</code> or <code>file:</code> URLs), must be
placed in the <code>_static</code> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility <code>doconce sphinxfix_localURLs</code> is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say <code>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</code> it
replaces the link by <code>_static/myfile.txt</code> and copies
<code>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</code> to a local <code>_static</code> directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in <code>_static</code> or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all <code>_static/*</code> files to the
<code>_static</code> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a <code>_static</code> or <code>_static-name</code> directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the <code>conf.py</code>
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
<code>make-themes.sh</code> can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes <code>fenics</code> and <code>pyramid</code>, one writes
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
</code>
The resulting directories with HTML documents are <code>_build/html_fenics</code>
and <code>_build/html_pyramid</code>, respectively. Without arguments,
<code>make-themes.sh</code> makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file <code>mydoc.do.txt</code>.

''Step 1.'' Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
</code>

''Step 2.'' Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive <code>sphinx-quickstart</code>
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
</code>
The autogenerated <code>conf.py</code> file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The <code>doconce sphinx_dir</code> generator makes an extended <code>conv.py</code>
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


''Step 3.'' Copy the <code>mydoc.rst</code> file to the Sphinx root directory:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
</code>
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with <code>mydoc.rst</code> in the <code>sphinx-rootdir</code>
directory. Either edit <code>mydoc.rst</code> so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to <code>sphinx-rootdir</code>.
Links to local files in <code>mydoc.rst</code> must be modified to links to
files in the <code>_static</code> directory, see comment above.

''Step 4.'' Edit the generated <code>index.rst</code> file so that <code>mydoc.rst</code>
is included, i.e., add <code>mydoc</code> to the <code>toctree</code> section so that it becomes
<code>
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
</code>
(The spaces before <code>mydoc</code> are important!)

''Step 5.'' Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
</code>

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with <code>index.html</code> files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

''Step 6.'' View the result:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
</code>

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows <code>!bc</code>: <code>cod</code> gives Python
(<code>code-block:: python</code> in Sphinx syntax) and <code>cppcod</code> gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

==== Wiki Formats ====

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
[http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax Googlecode wiki], MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
<code>gwiki</code>, <code>mwiki</code>, and <code>cwiki</code>, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
</code>

The Googlecode wiki document, <code>mydoc.gwiki</code>, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the <code>.gwiki</code> file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of [http://pediapress.com/code/ mwlib]. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write [http://en.wikibooks.org Wikibooks]
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.

==== Tweaking the Doconce Output ====

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
<code>.rst</code> file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if <code>.eps</code> or <code>.png</code> is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The <code>make.sh</code> files in <code>docs/manual</code> and <code>docs/tutorial</code>
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



== The Doconce Markup Language ==

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

==== Lists ====

An unordered bullet list makes use of the <code>*</code> as bullet sign
and is indented as follows

<code>
   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3
</code>

This list gets typeset as


<ul>
   <li> item 1   <li> item 2
<ul>
     <li><li> subitem 1, if there are more       lines, each line must       be intended as shown here     <li><li> subitem 2,       also spans two lines</ul>

   <li> item 3</ul>

In an ordered list, each item starts with an <code>o</code> (as the first letter
in "ordered"):

<code>
   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3
</code>

resulting in


<ol>
  <li> item 1  <li> item 2
<ul>
     <li><li> subitem 1     <li><li> subitem 2</ul>

  <li> item 3</ol>

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:

<code>
   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)
</code>

The result becomes


<dl>
   <dt>keyword1:<dd> 
     explanation of keyword1   <dt>keyword2:<dd> 
     explanation     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly     if there are multiple     lines)</dl>

==== Special Lines ====

The Doconce markup language has a concept called ''special lines''.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


''Heading with Title and Author(s).'' Lines starting with <code>TITLE:</code>, <code>AUTHOR:</code>, and <code>DATE:</code> are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax
<code>
name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3
</code>
The <code>at</code> with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the <code>and</code> with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax
<code>
name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2
</code>
Multiple authors require multiple <code>AUTHOR:</code> lines. All information
associated with <code>TITLE:</code> and <code>AUTHOR:</code> keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:
<code>
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: November 9, 2016
</code>
Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including <code>rst</code> and <code>sphinx</code>)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:
<code>
Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
A. Dummy Author

[1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
[2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
[3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
</code>
Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as <code>today</code>.


''Table of Contents.'' A table of contents can be generated by the line
<code>
TOC: on
</code>
This line is usually placed after the <code>DATE:</code> line.
A value <code>off</code> turns off the table of contents.


''Section Headings.'' Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):


<ul>
   <li> 9 <code>=</code> characters for chapters   <li> 7 for sections   <li> 5 for subsections   <li> 3 for subsubsections   <li> 2 ''underscrores'' (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs     (paragraph heading will be inlined)</ul>

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
''must'' be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples:
<code>
__Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
various section headings.

========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========

Some text.


======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.


===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====

The running text goes here.

===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.
</code>



== Special Lines ==

==== Figures ====

<!--> Note: need extra blank after FIGURE and MOVIE in !bc environments -->
<!--> because doconce treats !ec as part of the caption and moves the -->
<!--> !ec up to the caption line -->

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax
<code>
FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

</code>
The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say <code>.eps</code> when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's <code>convert</code> utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for <code>TITLE:</code> and <code>AUTHOR:</code> lines, all information
related to a figure line ''must be written on the same line''. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as <code>FIGURE:</code> will be
included in the formatted caption).


[[File:figs/streamtubes.png|frame|alt=figs/streamtubes.png| Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. (fig:viz)]]


Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
<code>montage</code> program from the ImageMagick suite:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
        file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png
</code>
The option <code>-tile XxY</code> gives <code>X</code> figures in the horizontal direction and
<code>Y</code> in the vertical direction (<code>tile 2x</code> means two figures per row
and <code>-tile x2</code> means two rows).

==== Movies ====

Here is an example on the <code>MOVIE:</code> keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the <code>latex</code>, <code>html</code>, <code>rst</code>, and <code>sphinx</code> formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.
<code>
MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption

</code>

<!--> latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies, -->
<!--> or just plain \hrun: ...{...} -->

 (Movie figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play mjolnir.html)

<!--> MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470] -->

<!--> MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470] -->

The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the <code>movie15</code> package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable <code>MOVIE15</code>. There is an associated variable
<code>EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER</code> which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc
</code>

The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
<code>myframes*.png</code>. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the <code>MOVIE:</code> command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).

==== Copying Computer Code from Source Files ====

Another type of special lines starts with <code>@@@CODE</code> and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section [#Blocks_of_Verbatim_Computer_Code] below.

==== Inline Tagging ====

Doconce supports tags for ''emphasized phrases'', '''boldface phrases''',
and <code>verbatim text</code> (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as <math>\nu = \sin(x)</math>.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in
<code>
*emphasized words*
</code>

Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:
<code>
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.
</code>
The line above gets typeset as
'''several words in boldface''' followed by ''ephasized text''.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks:
<code>
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.
</code>
The typesetting result looks like this:
<code>call myroutine(a, b)</code> looks like a Fortran call
while <code>void myfunc(double *a, double *b)</code> must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and <code>ptex2tex</code>) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as
<code>
some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
</code>
which appears as some URL like [http://google.com Search Google].
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in <code>.txt</code>, <code>.html</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.py</code>, <code>.f</code>,
<code>.f77</code>, <code>.f90</code>, <code>.f95</code>, <code>.sh</code>, <code>.csh</code>, <code>.ksh</code>, <code>.zsh</code>,
<code>.c</code>, <code>.cpp</code>, <code>.cxx</code>, <code>.pl</code>, and <code>.java</code> follows the same
setup:
<code>
see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".
</code>
which appears as see the [manual.do.txt Doconce Manual].
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:


<ul>
  <li> In the <code>html</code> format the links work well if the files are    supplied with the <code>.html</code> with the same relative location.  <li> In the <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> formats, such links in PDF files    will unless the <code>.tex</code> file has a full URL specified through    a <code>\hyperbaseurl</code> command and the linked files are located correctly    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.  <li> In the <code>sphinx</code> format, local files to which there are links should only be    located in a <code>_static</code> or <code>_static-name</code> subdirectory.</ul>

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a <code>_static</code> or <code>_static-name</code> directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (<code>name</code> is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the <code>html</code> format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
<code>pygmentize</code>, e.g.,
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
          -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh
</code>
Then you can link to <code>_static/make.sh.html</code> instead of
<code>subdir/make.sh</code>. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as <code>src/myprog.py</code> in her
software and the document links to <code>_static/myprog.py</code>:
<code>
See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").
</code>

Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
''the filename as link text''. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:
<code>
URL: "manual.html"
</code>
resulting in the link manual.html.

<!--> This is now automatically carried out by the autogenerated -->
<!--> script for sphinx: -->
<!--> For such local links to -->
<!--> work with the <code>sphinx</code> format, the <code>.rst</code> file needs a fix, carried -->
<!--> out by -->
<!--> !bc sys -->
<!--> doconce sphinxfix_localURLs mydoc.rst -->
<!--> !ec -->
<!--> (The files, such as <code>manual.html</code>, are then copied to a subdirectory -->
<!--> <code>_static</code>, which must be manually copied to the Sphinx directory's -->
<!--> <code>_static</code> directory - links in the <code>.rst</code> files are automatically -->
<!--> adjusted.) -->

Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:
<code>
Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".
</code>
resulting in Click on this link: http://code.google.com/p/doconce.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:
<code>
[name: comment]
</code>
where <code>name</code> is the name of the author of the command, and <code>comment</code> is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless <code>doconce format</code>
is run with a command-line argument <code>--skip_inline_comments</code>
(see the chapter [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats] for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the <code>.do.txt</code> file
(see the chapter [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats]).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII:

<code>
Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.
</code>
That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (<code>latex</code>, <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>html</code>,
<code>sphinx</code>, <code>mwiki</code>), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system <math>{\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}</math>, where <math>\bf A</math>
is an <math>n\times n</math> matrix, and <math>\bf x</math> and <math>\bf b</math>
are vectors of length <math>n</math>."

==== Comments ====

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as ''inline comments'' in Doconce and described
in the section [#Inline_Tagging].

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash <code>#</code>:
<code>
#
# Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
# These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
#
</code>
Such comment lines may have some side effects in the <code>rst</code> and <code>sphinx</code>
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out ''before''
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash <code>##</code> and lines enclosed by
the <code><%doc></code> (beginning) and <code><%doc/></code> (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.

==== Cross-Referencing ====

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:
<code>
label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.
</code>
This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
<code>rst</code> and <code>sphinx</code> formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by <code>doconce format</code>. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure fig:viz
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections [#LaTeX_Blocks_of_Mathematical_Text] and [#Macros_(Newcommands)] are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section [#Inline_Tagging].

==== Index and Bibliography ====

An index can be created for the <code>latex</code>, <code>rst</code>, and <code>sphinx</code> formats
by the <code>idx</code> keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:
<code>
idx{some index entry}
idx{main entry!subentry}
idx{`verbatim_text` and more}
</code>
The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to
<code>
\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}
</code>
Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: <code>idx</code>
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:
<code>
as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.
</code>
Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding <code>cite</code> command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like
<code>
as found in [3][14]
</code>
if <code>Larsen_1986</code> has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and <code>Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999</code> is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword <code>BIBFILE:</code>,
followed by a BibTeX file with extension <code>.bib</code>,
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension <code>.rst</code>,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension <code>.py</code>.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,
<code>
{
'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
""",
'Larsen_1986':
"""
O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
*Personal Press*. 1986.
"""
}
</code>

In the <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> formats, the <code>.bib</code> file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the <code>rst</code> and <code>sphinx</code> formats, the
<code>.rst</code> file will be copied into the document at the place where the
<code>BIBFILE:</code> keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the <code>BIBFILE:</code> line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is <code>myfile.bib</code>.
Insert <code>BIBFILE: myfile.bib</code> at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the <code>.rst</code> file, either by manual editing
of <code>myfile.bbl</code> or using <code>doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl</code> to automate (most of)
this editing. From the <code>myfile.rst</code> file it is easy to create <code>myfile.py</code>
with the dictionary version of the references.

<!--> see ketch/tex2rst for nice bibtex to rst converter which could -->
<!--> be used here -->

Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/ bibliograph.parsing] tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [1], a paper [2],
and both of them simultaneously [1] [2].

[somereader: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) ]

==== Tables ====

A table like

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>    time    </b></td> <td align="center"><b>  velocity  </b></td> <td align="center"><b>acceleration</b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   0.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.4186          </td> <td align="right">   -5.01           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   2.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.376512        </td> <td align="right">   11.919          </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="right">   4.0             </td> <td align="right">   1.1E+1          </td> <td align="right">   14.717624       </td> </tr>
</table>
is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:
<code>
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
</code>
The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters <code>c</code>, <code>r</code>, or <code>l</code> to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes <code>|</code> can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (<code>rst</code> and <code>sphinx</code> are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.

==== Exercises, Problems, or Projects ====

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
''exercise'', ''problem'', or ''project''.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 <code>=</code> characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this:
<code>
===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{proj:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf
solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt

Here goes the running text of the project....

</code>
Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project ''title'',
the ''label'', the ''result file'', the ''solution'' (if any of
these three entities is present), and the ''running text''. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with <code>!bsubex</code> and ending
with <code>!esubex</code>, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) ''answer'', and ''hints''. The environments have begin-end
directives <code>!bans</code>, <code>!eans</code>, <code>!bsol</code>, <code>!esol</code>, <code>!bhint</code>, <code>!ehint</code>, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
<code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code>).

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the <code>solution=...</code> directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows:
<code>
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf

Here goes the running text of the project....

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
</code>

The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file <code>.mydoc.exerinfo</code>,
if <code>mydoc.do.txt</code> is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The ''title'' is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem ..."
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".

==== Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code ====

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" <code>!bc</code> keyword and an "end code" <code>!ec</code> keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and ''start at the beginning of the
line''.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the <code>!bc</code> tag to specify a
certain environment (for <code>ptex2tex</code> or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, <code>!bc dat</code> corresponds to
the data file environment and <code>!bc cod</code> is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for <code>ptex2tex</code> this means the <code>ccq</code> environment,
which is defined in the config file <code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code>,
while for Sphinx it defaults to the <code>python</code> environment).

Since the config file for <code>ptex2tex</code> can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after <code>!bc</code> is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.,
<code>
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</code>
Here, three arguments are defined: <code>pycod</code> for Python code,
<code>cod</code> also for Python code, <code>cppcod</code> for C++ code, and <code>sys</code>
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in <code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code> for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, <code>pro</code> is used for complete programs in Python, <code>cod</code> is
for a code snippet in Python, while <code>xcod</code> and <code>xpro</code> implies computer
language specific typesetting where <code>x</code> can be <code>f</code> for Fortran, <code>c</code>
for C, <code>cpp</code> for C++, <code>sh</code> for Unix shells, <code>pl</code> for Perl, <code>m</code> for
Matlab, <code>cy</code> for Cython, and <code>py</code> for Python.  The argument <code>sys</code>
means by default <code>console</code> for Sphinx and <code>CodeTerminal</code> (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are <code>dat</code> for a data file
or print out, and <code>ipy</code> for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in <code>sphinx</code> output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after <code>!bc</code> can be redefined in the
<code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code> configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
<code>sphinx code-blocks</code> comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.

<!--> (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code -->
<!--> blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments -->
<!--> and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the -->
<!--> first one is used.) -->

The enclosing <code>!ec</code> tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (<code>pycod</code> style):
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
# regular expressions for inline tags:
inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
INLINE_TAGS = {
    'emphasize':
    r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'verbatim':
    r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'bold':
    r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
}
</code>
And here is a C++ code snippet (<code>cppcod</code> style):
<syntaxhighlight lang="cpp">
void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
        myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
    }
}
</code>

<!--> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise -->
<!--> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then
<code>
 @@@CODE myfile.f
 @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1
</code>
The first line implies that all lines in the file <code>myfile.f</code> are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a <code>!bc Xpro</code> environment, where
<code>X</code> is the extension of the filename, here <code>f</code> (i.e., the environment
becomes <code>!bc fpro</code> and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a <code>fromto:</code> directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, <code>X</code> is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the <code>pro</code> and <code>cod</code> arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain <code>!bc</code> environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
<code>@</code> sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching <code>subroutine test</code>
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching <code>C END1</code> (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):

<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
</code>

Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the <code>fromto:</code>
directive above:

<syntaxhighlight lang="fortran">
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
</code>

Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing <code>fromto:</code> by
<code>from-to</code> ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
# --- Start Example 1 ---
c = -1
A = 2
p0 = 4
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 1 ---

# --- Start Example 2 ---
c = -1
A = 1
p0 = 0
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 2 ---
</code>
is easy with
<code>
from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2
</code>
With only <code>fromto:</code> this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with <code>ptex2tex</code>: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in <code>ptex2tex</code>. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
<code>.p.tex</code> file to be treated by <code>ptex2tex</code>. However, the <code>@@@CODE</code> line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the <code>ptex2tex</code> configuration
file.)

==== LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text ====

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is <code>!bt</code> (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
<code>!et</code>. It is important that <code>!bt</code> and <code>!et</code> appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.
<code>
:<math>
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
</math>
</code>
Here is the result of the above <code>!bt</code> - <code>!et</code> block:
:<math>
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
</math>

The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
<code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> has of course full support. The <code>html</code> format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although <code>sphinx</code>, like <code>html</code>, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
(<code>pandoc</code> format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the <code>latex</code> format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After <code>#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")</code> one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
<code>#else</code> one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.

==== Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice ====

If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.


<ol>
 <li> Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file. <li> Go to the Sphinx directory and load the <code>conf.py</code> file into    a browser. <li> Search for "math" and comment out the    <code>'sphinx.ext.mathjax'</code> (enabled by default) and    <code>'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'</code> (disabled by default)    lines, and uncomment the <code>'sphinx.ext.pngmath'</code> package.    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures    of the mathematics. <li> Uncomment the line with <code>pngmath_dvipng_args =</code> and    set the PNG resolution to <code>-D 200</code> when the purpose is to    generate mathematics pictures for slides. <li> Run <code>make html</code>. <li> Look at the HTML source file in the <code>_build/html</code>    directory: all mathematics are in <code>img</code> tags with <code>src=</code>    pointing to a PNG file and <code>alt=</code> pointing to the LaTeX    source for the formula in question. This makes it very    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular    mathematical expression.</ol>

==== Macros (Newcommands) ====

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style ''newcommand''
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
<code>newcommand_replace.tex</code> are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names <code>newcommands.tex</code> and
<code>newcommands_keep.tex</code> are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
<code>!bt</code> and <code>!et</code> in <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code> to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
<code>newcommands_replace.tex</code> and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the <code>newcommands*.tex</code> files ''must'' appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

''Example.'' Suppose we have the following commands in
<code>newcommand_replace.tex</code>:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
\newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
\newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
\newcommand{\Q}{\pmb{Q}}
</code>

and these in <code>newcommands_keep.tex</code>:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
\newcommand{\x}{\pmb{x}}
\newcommand{\normalvec}{\pmb{n}}
\newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}
</code>

The LaTeX block
<code>
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
</code>
will then be rendered to
:<math>
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
</math>
in the current format.

==== Preprocessing Steps ====

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(http://code.google.com/p/preprocess) and mako
(http://www.makotemplates.org/). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of <code>name=value</code> command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable <code>FORMAT</code>
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (<code>html</code>, <code>latex</code>,
<code>plain</code>, <code>rst</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>epydoc</code>, <code>st</code>).  It is then easy to test on
the value of <code>FORMAT</code> and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example:

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
# If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
# PostScript files are used.

# #if FORMAT == "latex"
# Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
\begin{figure}
label{fig:wavepackets}
  \begin{center}
#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
#  #endif

#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
#  #endif
  \end{center}
  \caption{
  Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
  }
\end{figure}

# #else

# Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.

# #endif
</code>

Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats].

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.

==== Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces ====

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form <code>#include "file.do.txt"</code>.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate <code>.rst</code> files and an index file listing the various <code>.rst</code>
that build up the document. To generate the various <code>.rst</code> files one
should not run Doconce on the individual <code>.do.txt</code> files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script <code>doconce split_rst</code>
to split the long, complete <code>.rst</code> into pieces. This process requires
that each <code>#include "file.do.txt</code> line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax <code>#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>></code>, where
<code>file</code> is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword <code>part:</code>.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is <code>master.do.txt</code>.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run
<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake_sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi
</code>
The autogenerated <code>automake_sphinx.sh</code> file (by <code>doconce sphinx_dir</code>)
is compatible with a master <code>.rst</code> file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to <code>doconce sphinx_dir</code>.
This set is the output of <code>doconce split_rst</code>, which we catch in a
variable <code>files</code> above.

==== Missing Features ====

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line

<syntaxhighlight lang="python">
# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
# insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
# #else
# insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
# #endif
</code>

Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say
<code>
# table of contents
</code>
we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce <code>doconce format latex mydoc</code> to produce <code>mydoc.p.tex</code>. Then
we use the <code>doconce replace</code> and <code>doconce subst</code> commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:
<code>
Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
</code>
The <code>doconce replace from_text to_text filename</code> command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the <code>replace</code> method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with <code>\tableofcontents</code>, we should use <code>doconce subst</code>,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:
<code>
Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
</code>
Note the double backshlash in front of the <code>t</code> character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The <code>doconce subst</code> is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

==== Header and Footer ====

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if <code>TITLE:</code> or
<code>#TITLE:</code> is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.

==== Emacs Doconce Formatter ====

The file <code>misc/.doconce-mode.el</code> in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

''Step 1.'' Download the Doconce tarball from <code>code.google.com/p/doconce</code>,
pack it out and go to the root directory.

''Step 2.'' Copy the <code>doconce-mode.el</code> file to the home directory:
<code>
cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME
</code>

''Step 3.'' Add these lines to <code>$HOME/.emacs</code>:
<code>
(load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
(setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))
</code>
Emacs will now recognize files with extension <code>.do.txt</code> and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.



== Troubleshooting ==

==== Disclaimer ====

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running <code>doconce format</code>, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.

==== General Problems ====

==== Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step ====

Doconce automatically removes the file <code>__tmp.do.txt</code>, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when <code>mako</code> and/or
<code>preprocess</code> is run). Add the <code>--debug</code> flag at the end of the
<code>doconce</code> command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
<code>__tmp.do.txt</code> is deleted.

==== Figure captions are incomplete ====

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as ''one line'', at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

==== Preprocessor directives do not work ====

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

==== Problems with boldface and emphasize ====

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

==== Links to local directories do not work ====

Links of the type
<code>
see the "examples directory": "src/examples"
</code>
do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file:
<code>
see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"
</code>

==== Links are not typeset correctly ====

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim:
<code>
see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".
</code>
However, the following will not be typeset correctly:
<code>
see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"
</code>
The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.

==== Inline verbatim code is not detected ====

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

==== Strange non-English characters ====

Check the encoding of the <code>.do.txt</code> file with the Unix <code>file</code> command
or with
<code>
Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
</code>
If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands
<code>
Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt

Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
</code>

==== Wrong Norwegian charcters ====

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run <code>doconce change_encoding</code> to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

==== Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly ====

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

==== Too short underlining of reST headlines ====

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.

==== Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG) ====

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first <code>!bt</code> (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

==== Problems with code or Tex Blocks ====

==== Code or math block errors in reST ====

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a <code>!bc</code>, which should have been removed when
running <code>doconce format sphinx</code>, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then <code>!bc</code> will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

==== Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST ====

If <code>idx</code> commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

==== Something is wrong with a verbatim code block ====

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

==== Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format ====

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before <code>!bt</code> and <code>!bc</code> environments.

==== Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly ====

Read the the section [#Blocks_of_Verbatim_Computer_Code] above.  Start the
<code>!bc</code> and <code>!ec</code> tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

==== LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly ====

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the <code>!bt</code> and <code>!et</code> tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.

==== Problems with reST/Sphinx Output ====

==== Lists do not appear in .rst files ====

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

==== Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST ====

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

==== Warning about duplicate link names ====

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

==== Inconsistent headings in reST ====

The <code>rst2*.py</code> and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for <code>===</code>,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

==== No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks ====

The <code>!bc ipy</code> directive behaves this way for <code>sphinx</code> output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to <code>!bc cod</code> or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

==== Problems with LaTeX Output ====

==== Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed ====

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the <code>-shell-escape</code> command-line argument when
running <code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code>:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
</code>
Using <code>doconce ptex2tex</code> will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using <code>ptex2tex</code> requires the
preprocessor option <code>-DMINTED</code> to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, <code>latex</code> or <code>pdflatex</code> runs the
<code>pygmentize</code> program and the <code>shell-escape</code> option is required.

==== How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments? ====

Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via <code>doconce replace</code>. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code:

<code>
<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.
</code>
The <code>.p.tex</code> output file now reads
<code>
% begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
</code>
Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the <code>% begin ...</code> and <code>% end ...</code> lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the <code>.p.tex</code> file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with ''Theorem''.
The following Bash script does the job:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
file=mydoc.p.tex
thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file
</code>
More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
<code>mydoc.p.tex</code> file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting <code>mydoc.tex</code> file now becomes
<code>
\usepackage{theorem}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]

...

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
</code>
Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the <code>ptex2tex</code> program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).

==== The LaTeX file does not compile ====

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
<code>
\code{...}
</code>
the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

==== Inline verbatim gives error ====

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.,
<code>
some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
then replace this by
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
capture the second }
</code>
The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.

<!--> Could have doconce configure file where inline verbatim is -->
<!--> configured to be \fontsize... directly, not via ptex2tex \code{}. -->

==== Errors in figure captions ====

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper <code>texttt</code> command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

==== Chapters are ignored ====

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run <code>ptex2tex</code> with the option <code>-DBOOK</code> to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

==== I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file ====

The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:


<ol>
<li> Make a little Bash script that performs a series of   <code>doconce subst</code> (regular expressions) or <code>doconce replace</code> (regular text)   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).<li> Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This   means that the <code>doconce format latex</code> command does not generate   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these   files.   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro   text and include the various text pieces in this file.   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.</ol>

==== Problems with gwiki Output ====

==== Strange nested lists in gwiki ====

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the <code>.gwiki</code> file directly.

==== Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source ====

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

==== Problems with HTML Output ====

==== How can I change the layout of the HTML page? ====

The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out <code>TITLE:</code> to get HTML without a header and footer). The
<code>--html-template=filename</code> command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title (<code>%(title)s</code>),
a date (<code>%(date)s</code>), and the main body of text (<code>%(main)s</code>).
For typesetting code, <code>pygments</code> is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by <code>--no-pygments-html</code> (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the <code>sphinx</code> format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via <code>doconce replace</code> and
<code>doconce subst</code> in the script that generates the final documents).

==== Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates? ====

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script:

<code>
doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
 '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
 '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html
</code>

==== Debugging ====

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
<code>_doconce_debugging.log</code>, if the to <code>doconce format</code> after the filename
is <code>debug</code>. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



== Basic Parsing Ideas ==

<!--> avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea) -->

The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression

<code>
(?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?
</code>

That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.

==== Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables ====

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and ''placed at the end of
the doc string''. Note that <code>argument</code>, <code>keyword argument</code>, <code>return</code>,
<code>instance variable</code>, <code>class variable</code>, and <code>module variable</code> are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.

<code>
    - argument x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
    - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
    - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
    - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
    - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
      (bool variable).
</code>

The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.


<dl>
    <dt>*module variable* x:<dd> 
      x value (float),      which must be a positive number.    <dt>*module variable* tolerance:<dd> 
      tolerance (float) for stopping      the iterations.</dl>

= What Is Doconce? =

Doconce is two things:


 # Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,    emails). From reST you can (via {{{rst2*}}} programs) go to XML, HTML,    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via {{{unoconv}}}) to    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.
 # Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:


  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than    LaTeX and HTML.
  * Doconce can be converted to plain //untagged// text,    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code    directly from the source code files via regular expressions    for the start and end lines.
  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:


  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



= Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies =


== Doconce ==

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at [[http://code.google.com/p/doconce]].  Its installation from the
Mercurial ({{{hg}}}) source follows the standard procedure:
{{{
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
{{{
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
{{{
sudo apt-get install doconce
}}}
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
{{{
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
}}}


== Dependencies ==

=== Preprocessors ===

If you make use of the [[http://code.google.com/p/preprocess|Preprocess]]
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

{{{
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
[[http://www.makotemplates.org|Mako]]. Its installation is most
conveniently done by {{{pip}}},

{{{
pip install Mako
}}}
This command requires {{{pip}}} to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

{{{
sudo apt-get install python-pip
}}}
Alternatively, one can install from the {{{pip}}} [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip|source code]].

=== Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output ===

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need [[http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex|ptex2tex]],
which is installed by

{{{
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
}}}
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, {{{cp2texmf.sh}}}:

{{{
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
}}}
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that {{{ptex2tex}}} potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

{{{
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
}}}
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the {{{~/texmf/tex/latex/misc}}} directory).

Note that the {{{doconce ptex2tex}}} command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the {{{ptex2tex}}}
program.

The //minted// LaTeX style is offered by {{{ptex2tex}}} and {{{doconce ptext2tex}}}
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package [[http://pygments.org|Pygments]]
to be installed:
{{{
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

If you use the minted style together with {{{ptex2tex}}}, you have to
enable it by the {{{-DMINTED}}} command-line argument to {{{ptex2tex}}}.  All
use of the minted style requires the {{{-shell-escape}}} command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., {{{latex -shell-escape}}} or {{{pdflatex
-shell-escape}}}.

<wiki:comment> Say something about anslistings.sty </wiki:comment>

=== reStructuredText (reST) Output ===

The {{{rst}}} output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the [[http://docutils.sourceforge.net|docutils]] package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

{{{
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
{{{
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
}}}

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
[[http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf|rst2pdf]]. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the {{{rst2pdf}}} directory and
run the usual {{{sudo python setup.py install}}}.


Output to {{{sphinx}}} requires of course [[http://sphinx.pocoo.org|Sphinx]],
installed by
{{{
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
}}}

=== Markdown and Pandoc Output ===

The Doconce format {{{pandoc}}} outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the {{{pandoc}}} program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/|Pandoc]], written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

{{{
sudo apt-get install pandoc
}}}

=== Epydoc Output ===

When the output format is {{{epydoc}}} one needs that program too, installed
by
{{{
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
}}}

//Remark.// Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
{{{apt-get install}}} command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For {{{svn}}} directories, go to the directory,
run {{{svn update}}}, and then {{{sudo python setup.py install}}}. For
Mercurial ({{{hg}}}) directories, go to the directory, run
{{{hg pull; hg update}}}, and then {{{sudo python setup.py install}}}.

<wiki:comment>  </wiki:comment>


== Demos ==

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the
{{{
docs/manual/manual.do.txt
}}}
file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
[[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html|demo web page]]
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file {{{make.sh}}} in the same directory as the {{{manual.do.txt}}} file
(the current text) shows how to run {{{doconce format}}} on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in
{{{
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
}}}
In the {{{tutorial}}} directory there is also a {{{make.sh}}} file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
[[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html|web demo]]
of the results.

<wiki:comment> Example on including another Doconce file: </wiki:comment>



= From Doconce to Other Formats =

Transformation of a Doconce document {{{mydoc.do.txt}}} to various other
formats applies the script {{{doconce format}}}:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
}}}
or just
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
}}}
The {{{mako}}} or {{{preprocess}}} programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to {{{mako}}} or {{{preprocess}}} can be added after the
filename. For example,
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
}}}
The variable {{{FORMAT}}} is always defined as the current format when
running {{{preprocess}}}. That is, in the last example, {{{FORMAT}}} is
defined as {{{latex}}}. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like {{{#if FORMAT == "latex"}}}.

The command-line arguments {{{--no-preprocess}}} and {{{--no-mako}}} turn off
running {{{preprocess}}} and {{{mako}}}, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
}}}
One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:
{{{
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
}}}
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


== HTML ==

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file {{{mydoc.do.txt}}}
is performed by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
}}}
The resulting file {{{mydoc.html}}} can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the {{{pygmentize}}} program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument {{{--no-pygments-html}}}
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain {{{<pre>}}} HTML tags. The option {{{--pygments-html-linenos}}} turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": {{{%(title)s}}} for a title,
{{{%(date)s}}} for a date, and {{{%(main)s}}} for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
{{{DATE:}}} line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert {{{%(title)s}}} and
{{{%(date)s}}} at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by {{{%(main)s}}}. Here is an example:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
}}}


== Pandoc and Markdown ==

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from
{{{
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
}}}
The name of the output file is {{{mydoc.mkd}}}.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:
{{{
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
}}}
Pandoc supports {{{latex}}}, {{{html}}}, {{{odt}}} (OpenOffice), {{{docx}}} (Microsoft
Word), {{{rtf}}}, {{{texinfo}}}, to mention some. The {{{-R}}} option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the {{{--toc}}} option generates a table of contents.
See the [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html|Pandoc documentation]]
for the many features of the {{{pandoc}}} program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
{{{doconce format pandoc}}} and then translating using {{{pandoc}}}, or
{{{doconce format latex}}}, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using {{{pandoc}}}.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
}}}
When we go through {{{pandoc}}}, only single equations or {{{align*}}}
environments are well understood.

Quite some {{{doconce replace}}} and {{{doconce subst}}} edits might be needed
on the {{{.mkd}}} or {{{.tex}}} files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
}}}
The {{{-s}}} option adds a proper header and footer to the {{{mydoc.html}}} file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


== LaTeX ==

Making a LaTeX file {{{mydoc.tex}}} from {{{mydoc.do.txt}}} is done in two steps:
<wiki:comment> Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> environment, as used here. </wiki:comment>

//Step 1.// Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form {{{mydoc.p.tex}}} for
the {{{ptex2tex}}} program (or {{{doconce ptex2tex}}}):
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
}}}
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files {{{newcommands.tex}}}, {{{newcommands_keep.tex}}}, or
{{{newcommands_replace.tex}}} (see the section [#Macros_(Newcommands)]).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

//Step 2.// Run {{{ptex2tex}}} (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
}}}
In case you do not have {{{ptex2tex}}}, you may run a (very) simplified version:
{{{
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
}}}

Note that Doconce generates a {{{.p.tex}}} file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
}}}
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through {{{-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional}}}.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
{{{-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage}}}.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are


 * {{{BOOK}}} for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 * {{{PALATINO}}} for the Palatino font
 * {{{HELVETIA}}} for the Helvetica font
 * {{{A4PAPER}}} for A4 paper size
 * {{{A6PAPER}}} for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 * {{{MOVIE15}}} for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 * {{{PREAMBLE}}} to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document   or document to be included elsewhere)
 * {{{MINTED}}} for inclusion of the minted package (which requires {{{latex}}}   or {{{pdflatex}}} to be run with the {{{-shell-escape}}} option)

The {{{ptex2tex}}} tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any {{{!bc}}} command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your {{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}}
file, e.g., {{{!bc sys}}} for a terminal session, where {{{sys}}} is set to
a certain environment in {{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}} (e.g., {{{CodeTerminal}}}).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the {{{doconce ptex2tex}}} command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the {{{.p.tex}}} file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:
{{{
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
}}}
Note that {{{@}}} must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as {{{minted}}}
above, which implies {{{\begin{minted}{fortran}}}} and {{{\end{minted}}}} as
begin and end for blocks inside {{{!bc fpro}}} and {{{!ec}}}).  Specifying
{{{envir=ans:nt}}} means that all other environments are typeset with the
{{{anslistings.sty}}} package, e.g., {{{!bc cppcod}}} will then result in
{{{\begin{c++}}}}. If no environments like {{{sys}}}, {{{fpro}}}, or the common
{{{envir}}} are defined on the command line, the plain {{{\begin{verbatim}}}}
and {{{\end{verbatim}}}} used.


//Step 2b (optional).// Edit the {{{mydoc.tex}}} file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute {{{section}}} by {{{section*}}} to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the {{{doconce replace}}} and {{{doconce subst}}}
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:
{{{
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
}}}
A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

//Step 3.// Compile {{{mydoc.tex}}}
and create the PDF file:
{{{
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}

If one wishes to run {{{ptex2tex}}} and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks ({{{Minted_Python}}}, {{{Minted_Cpp}}}, etc., in
{{{ptex2tex}}} specified through the {{{*pro}}} and {{{*cod}}} variables in
{{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}} or {{{$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg}}}), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running {{{ptex2tex}}} with the
{{{-DMINTED}}} option:
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
}}}
In this case, {{{latex}}} must be run with the
{{{-shell-escape}}} option:
{{{
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}
When running {{{doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted}}} (or other minted
specifications with {{{doconce ptex2tex}}}), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the {{{-DMINTED}}} option.


== PDFLaTeX ==

Running {{{pdflatex}}} instead of {{{latex}}} follows almost the same steps,
but the start is
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
}}}
Then {{{ptex2tex}}} is run as explained above, and finally
{{{
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
}}}


== Plain ASCII Text ==

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
}}}


== reStructuredText ==

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file {{{mydoc.rst}}}:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
}}}
We may now produce various other formats:
{{{
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
}}}

The OpenOffice file {{{mydoc.odt}}} can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program {{{unovonv}}}
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports //on the command line//.
Run
{{{
Terminal> unoconv --show
}}}
to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
{{{mydoc.odt}}} to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:
{{{
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
}}}

//Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.// At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by {{{latex}}} as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the {{{sphinx}}} output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

== Sphinx ==

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the {{{doconce sphinx_dir}}} command:
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
}}}
The keywords {{{author}}}, {{{title}}}, and {{{version}}} are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, {{{version}}} is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files {{{file1}}},
{{{file2}}}, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files {{{file1}}}, {{{file2}}}, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of {{{dirname}}} is {{{sphinx-rootdir}}}. The {{{theme}}}
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is {{{'default'}}}).

With a single-file document in {{{mydoc.do.txt}}} one often just runs
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
}}}
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory {{{sphinx-rootdir}}} is made with
relevant files.

The {{{doconce sphinx_dir}}} command generates a script
{{{automake_sphinx.py}}} for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run {{{automake_sphinx.py}}} or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The {{{doconce sphinx_dir}}} script copies directories named {{{figs}}} or
{{{figures}}} over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, {{{automake_sphinx.py}}} must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not {{{http:}}} or {{{file:}}} URLs), must be
placed in the {{{_static}}} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility {{{doconce sphinxfix_localURLs}}} is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say {{{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt}}} it
replaces the link by {{{_static/myfile.txt}}} and copies
{{{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt}}} to a local {{{_static}}} directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in {{{_static}}} or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all {{{_static/*}}} files to the
{{{_static}}} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a {{{_static}}} or {{{_static-name}}} directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the {{{conf.py}}}
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
{{{make-themes.sh}}} can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes {{{fenics}}} and {{{pyramid}}}, one writes
{{{
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
}}}
The resulting directories with HTML documents are {{{_build/html_fenics}}}
and {{{_build/html_pyramid}}}, respectively. Without arguments,
{{{make-themes.sh}}} makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file {{{mydoc.do.txt}}}.

//Step 1.// Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
}}}

//Step 2.// Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive {{{sphinx-quickstart}}}
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
{{{
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
}}}
The autogenerated {{{conf.py}}} file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The {{{doconce sphinx_dir}}} generator makes an extended {{{conv.py}}}
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


//Step 3.// Copy the {{{mydoc.rst}}} file to the Sphinx root directory:
{{{
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
}}}
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with {{{mydoc.rst}}} in the {{{sphinx-rootdir}}}
directory. Either edit {{{mydoc.rst}}} so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to {{{sphinx-rootdir}}}.
Links to local files in {{{mydoc.rst}}} must be modified to links to
files in the {{{_static}}} directory, see comment above.

//Step 4.// Edit the generated {{{index.rst}}} file so that {{{mydoc.rst}}}
is included, i.e., add {{{mydoc}}} to the {{{toctree}}} section so that it becomes
{{{
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
}}}
(The spaces before {{{mydoc}}} are important!)

//Step 5.// Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
{{{
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
}}}

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with {{{index.html}}} files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

//Step 6.// View the result:
{{{
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
}}}

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows {{{!bc}}}: {{{cod}}} gives Python
({{{code-block:: python}}} in Sphinx syntax) and {{{cppcod}}} gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


== Wiki Formats ==

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
[[http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax|Googlecode wiki]], MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
{{{gwiki}}}, {{{mwiki}}}, and {{{cwiki}}}, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
}}}

The Googlecode wiki document, {{{mydoc.gwiki}}}, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the {{{.gwiki}}} file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of [[http://pediapress.com/code/|mwlib]]. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write [[http://en.wikibooks.org|Wikibooks]]
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


== Tweaking the Doconce Output ==

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
{{{.rst}}} file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if {{{.eps}}} or {{{.png}}} is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The {{{make.sh}}} files in {{{docs/manual}}} and {{{docs/tutorial}}}
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



= The Doconce Markup Language =

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.


== Lists ==

An unordered bullet list makes use of the {{{*}}} as bullet sign
and is indented as follows

{{{
   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3
}}}

This list gets typeset as


   * item 1
   * item 2

     ** subitem 1, if there are more       lines, each line must       be intended as shown here
     //* subitem 2,       also spans two lines


   // item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an {{{o}}} (as the first letter
in "ordered"):

{{{
   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3
}}}

resulting in


  # item 1
  # item 2

     ** subitem 1
     //* subitem 2


  # item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:

{{{
   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)
}}}

The result becomes


   // keyword1:  
     explanation of keyword1
   * keyword2:  
     explanation     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly     if there are multiple     lines)


== Special Lines ==

The Doconce markup language has a concept called //special lines//.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


//Heading with Title and Author(s).// Lines starting with {{{TITLE:}}}, {{{AUTHOR:}}}, and {{{DATE:}}} are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax
{{{
name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3
}}}
The {{{at}}} with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the {{{and}}} with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax
{{{
name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2
}}}
Multiple authors require multiple {{{AUTHOR:}}} lines. All information
associated with {{{TITLE:}}} and {{{AUTHOR:}}} keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:
{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: November 9, 2016
}}}
Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including {{{rst}}} and {{{sphinx}}})
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:
{{{
Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
A. Dummy Author

[1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
[2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
[3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
}}}
Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as {{{today}}}.


//Table of Contents.// A table of contents can be generated by the line
{{{
TOC: on
}}}
This line is usually placed after the {{{DATE:}}} line.
A value {{{off}}} turns off the table of contents.


//Section Headings.// Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):


   * 9 {{{=}}} characters for chapters
   * 7 for sections
   * 5 for subsections
   * 3 for subsubsections
   * 2 //underscrores// (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
//must// be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples:
{{{
__Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
various section headings.

========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========

Some text.


======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.


===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====

The running text goes here.

===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.
}}}



= Special Lines =


== Figures ==

<wiki:comment> Note: need extra blank after FIGURE and MOVIE in !bc environments </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> because doconce treats !ec as part of the caption and moves the </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> !ec up to the caption line </wiki:comment>

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax
{{{
FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

}}}
The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say {{{.eps}}} when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's {{{convert}}} utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for {{{TITLE:}}} and {{{AUTHOR:}}} lines, all information
related to a figure line //must be written on the same line//. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as {{{FIGURE:}}} will be
included in the formatted caption).

{{figs/streamtubes.png| Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. (fig:viz)}}

Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
{{{montage}}} program from the ImageMagick suite:
{{{
montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
        file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png
}}}
The option {{{-tile XxY}}} gives {{{X}}} figures in the horizontal direction and
{{{Y}}} in the vertical direction ({{{tile 2x}}} means two figures per row
and {{{-tile x2}}} means two rows).


== Movies ==

Here is an example on the {{{MOVIE:}}} keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the {{{latex}}}, {{{html}}}, {{{rst}}}, and {{{sphinx}}} formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.
{{{
MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption

}}}

<wiki:comment> latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies, </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> or just plain \hrun: ...{...} </wiki:comment>

 (Movie figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play [[mjolnir.html]])

<wiki:comment> MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470] </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470] </wiki:comment>

The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the {{{movie15}}} package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable {{{MOVIE15}}}. There is an associated variable
{{{EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER}}} which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc
}}}

The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
{{{myframes*.png}}}. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the {{{MOVIE:}}} command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).


== Copying Computer Code from Source Files ==

Another type of special lines starts with {{{@@@CODE}}} and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section [#Blocks_of_Verbatim_Computer_Code] below.


== Inline Tagging ==

Doconce supports tags for //emphasized phrases//, **boldface phrases**,
and {{{verbatim text}}} (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x).

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in
{{{
*emphasized words*
}}}

Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:
{{{
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.
}}}
The line above gets typeset as
**several words in boldface** followed by //ephasized text//.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks:
{{{
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.
}}}
The typesetting result looks like this:
{{{call myroutine(a, b)}}} looks like a Fortran call
while {{{void myfunc(double *a, double *b)}}} must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and {{{ptex2tex}}}) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as
{{{
some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
}}}
which appears as some URL like [[http://google.com|Search Google]].
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in {{{.txt}}}, {{{.html}}}, {{{.pdf}}}, {{{.py}}}, {{{.f}}},
{{{.f77}}}, {{{.f90}}}, {{{.f95}}}, {{{.sh}}}, {{{.csh}}}, {{{.ksh}}}, {{{.zsh}}},
{{{.c}}}, {{{.cpp}}}, {{{.cxx}}}, {{{.pl}}}, and {{{.java}}} follows the same
setup:
{{{
see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".
}}}
which appears as see the [[manual.do.txt|Doconce Manual]].
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:


  * In the {{{html}}} format the links work well if the files are    supplied with the {{{.html}}} with the same relative location.
  * In the {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}} formats, such links in PDF files    will unless the {{{.tex}}} file has a full URL specified through    a {{{\hyperbaseurl}}} command and the linked files are located correctly    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.
  * In the {{{sphinx}}} format, local files to which there are links should only be    located in a {{{_static}}} or {{{_static-name}}} subdirectory.

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a {{{_static}}} or {{{_static-name}}} directory and makes links to
files in this directory only ({{{name}}} is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the {{{html}}} format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
{{{pygmentize}}}, e.g.,
{{{
Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
          -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh
}}}
Then you can link to {{{_static/make.sh.html}}} instead of
{{{subdir/make.sh}}}. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as {{{src/myprog.py}}} in her
software and the document links to {{{_static/myprog.py}}}:
{{{
See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").
}}}

Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
//the filename as link text//. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:
{{{
URL: "manual.html"
}}}
resulting in the link [[manual.html]].

<wiki:comment> This is now automatically carried out by the autogenerated </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> script for sphinx: </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> For such local links to </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> work with the {{{sphinx}}} format, the {{{.rst}}} file needs a fix, carried </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> out by </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> !bc sys </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> doconce sphinxfix_localURLs mydoc.rst </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> !ec </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> (The files, such as {{{manual.html}}}, are then copied to a subdirectory </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> {{{_static}}}, which must be manually copied to the Sphinx directory's </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> {{{_static}}} directory - links in the {{{.rst}}} files are automatically </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> adjusted.) </wiki:comment>

Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:
{{{
Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".
}}}
resulting in Click on this link: [[http://code.google.com/p/doconce]].

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:
{{{
[name: comment]
}}}
where {{{name}}} is the name of the author of the command, and {{{comment}}} is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless {{{doconce format}}}
is run with a command-line argument {{{--skip_inline_comments}}}
(see the chapter [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats] for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the {{{.do.txt}}} file
(see the chapter [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats]).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII:

{{{
Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.
}}}
That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support ({{{latex}}}, {{{pdflatex}}}, {{{html}}},
{{{sphinx}}}, {{{mwiki}}}), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system Ax=b, where A
is an nxn matrix, and x and b
are vectors of length n."


== Comments ==

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as //inline comments// in Doconce and described
in the section [#Inline_Tagging].

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash {{{#}}}:
{{{
#
# Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
# These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
#
}}}
Such comment lines may have some side effects in the {{{rst}}} and {{{sphinx}}}
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out //before//
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash {{{##}}} and lines enclosed by
the {{{<%doc>}}} (beginning) and {{{<%doc/>}}} (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.


== Cross-Referencing ==

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:
{{{
label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.
}}}
This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
{{{rst}}} and {{{sphinx}}} formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by {{{doconce format}}}. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure fig:viz
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections [#LaTeX_Blocks_of_Mathematical_Text] and [#Macros_(Newcommands)] are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section [#Inline_Tagging].


== Index and Bibliography ==

An index can be created for the {{{latex}}}, {{{rst}}}, and {{{sphinx}}} formats
by the {{{idx}}} keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:
{{{
idx{some index entry}
idx{main entry!subentry}
idx{`verbatim_text` and more}
}}}
The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to
{{{
\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}
}}}
Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: {{{idx}}}
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:
{{{
as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.
}}}
Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding {{{cite}}} command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like
{{{
as found in [3][14]
}}}
if {{{Larsen_1986}}} has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and {{{Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}}} is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword {{{BIBFILE:}}},
followed by a BibTeX file with extension {{{.bib}}},
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension {{{.rst}}},
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension {{{.py}}}.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,
{{{
{
'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
""",
'Larsen_1986':
"""
O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
*Personal Press*. 1986.
"""
}
}}}

In the {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}} formats, the {{{.bib}}} file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the {{{rst}}} and {{{sphinx}}} formats, the
{{{.rst}}} file will be copied into the document at the place where the
{{{BIBFILE:}}} keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the {{{BIBFILE:}}} line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is {{{myfile.bib}}}.
Insert {{{BIBFILE: myfile.bib}}} at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the {{{.rst}}} file, either by manual editing
of {{{myfile.bbl}}} or using {{{doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl}}} to automate (most of)
this editing. From the {{{myfile.rst}}} file it is easy to create {{{myfile.py}}}
with the dictionary version of the references.

<wiki:comment> see ketch/tex2rst for nice bibtex to rst converter which could </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> be used here </wiki:comment>

Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/|bibliograph.parsing]] tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [1], a paper [2],
and both of them simultaneously [1] [2].

[somereader: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) ]


== Tables ==

A table like


 | =time             | =velocity         | =acceleration     |
 |  0.0              |  1.4186           |  -5.01            |
 |  2.0              |  1.376512         |  11.919           |
 |  4.0              |  1.1E+1           |  14.717624        |


is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:
{{{
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
}}}
The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters {{{c}}}, {{{r}}}, or {{{l}}} to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes {{{|}}} can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables ({{{rst}}} and {{{sphinx}}} are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.


== Exercises, Problems, or Projects ==

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
//exercise//, //problem//, or //project//.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 {{{=}}} characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this:
{{{
===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{proj:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf
solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt

Here goes the running text of the project....

}}}
Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project //title//,
the //label//, the //result file//, the //solution// (if any of
these three entities is present), and the //running text//. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with {{{!bsubex}}} and ending
with {{{!esubex}}}, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) //answer//, and //hints//. The environments have begin-end
directives {{{!bans}}}, {{{!eans}}}, {{{!bsol}}}, {{{!esol}}}, {{{!bhint}}}, {{{!ehint}}}, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
{{{!bc}}} and {{{!ec}}}).

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the {{{solution=...}}} directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows:
{{{
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf

Here goes the running text of the project....

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
}}}

The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file {{{.mydoc.exerinfo}}},
if {{{mydoc.do.txt}}} is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The //title// is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem ..."
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".


== Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code ==

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" {{{!bc}}} keyword and an "end code" {{{!ec}}} keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and //start at the beginning of the
line//.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the {{{!bc}}} tag to specify a
certain environment (for {{{ptex2tex}}} or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, {{{!bc dat}}} corresponds to
the data file environment and {{{!bc cod}}} is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for {{{ptex2tex}}} this means the {{{ccq}}} environment,
which is defined in the config file {{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}},
while for Sphinx it defaults to the {{{python}}} environment).

Since the config file for {{{ptex2tex}}} can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after {{{!bc}}} is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.,
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
Here, three arguments are defined: {{{pycod}}} for Python code,
{{{cod}}} also for Python code, {{{cppcod}}} for C++ code, and {{{sys}}}
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in {{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}} for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, {{{pro}}} is used for complete programs in Python, {{{cod}}} is
for a code snippet in Python, while {{{xcod}}} and {{{xpro}}} implies computer
language specific typesetting where {{{x}}} can be {{{f}}} for Fortran, {{{c}}}
for C, {{{cpp}}} for C++, {{{sh}}} for Unix shells, {{{pl}}} for Perl, {{{m}}} for
Matlab, {{{cy}}} for Cython, and {{{py}}} for Python.  The argument {{{sys}}}
means by default {{{console}}} for Sphinx and {{{CodeTerminal}}} (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are {{{dat}}} for a data file
or print out, and {{{ipy}}} for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in {{{sphinx}}} output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after {{{!bc}}} can be redefined in the
{{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}} configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
{{{sphinx code-blocks}}} comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.

<wiki:comment> (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> first one is used.) </wiki:comment>

The enclosing {{{!ec}}} tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code ({{{pycod}}} style):
{{{
# regular expressions for inline tags:
inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
INLINE_TAGS = {
    'emphasize':
    r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'verbatim':
    r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'bold':
    r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
}
}}}
And here is a C++ code snippet ({{{cppcod}}} style):
{{{
void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
        myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
    }
}
}}}

<wiki:comment> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... </wiki:comment>
Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then
{{{
 @@@CODE myfile.f
 @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1
}}}
The first line implies that all lines in the file {{{myfile.f}}} are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a {{{!bc Xpro}}} environment, where
{{{X}}} is the extension of the filename, here {{{f}}} (i.e., the environment
becomes {{{!bc fpro}}} and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a {{{fromto:}}} directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, {{{X}}} is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the {{{pro}}} and {{{cod}}} arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain {{{!bc}}} environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
{{{@}}} sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching {{{subroutine test}}}
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching {{{C END1}}} (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):

{{{
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}

Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the {{{fromto:}}}
directive above:

{{{
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
}}}

Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing {{{fromto:}}} by
{{{from-to}}} ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text
{{{
# --- Start Example 1 ---
c = -1
A = 2
p0 = 4
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 1 ---

# --- Start Example 2 ---
c = -1
A = 1
p0 = 0
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 2 ---
}}}
is easy with
{{{
from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2
}}}
With only {{{fromto:}}} this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with {{{ptex2tex}}}: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in {{{ptex2tex}}}. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
{{{.p.tex}}} file to be treated by {{{ptex2tex}}}. However, the {{{@@@CODE}}} line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the {{{ptex2tex}}} configuration
file.)


== LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text ==

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is {{{!bt}}} (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
{{{!et}}}. It is important that {{{!bt}}} and {{{!et}}} appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.
{{{
{{{
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
}}}
}}}
Here is the result of the above {{{!bt}}} - {{{!et}}} block:
{{{
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
}}}

The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
{{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}} has of course full support. The {{{html}}} format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although {{{sphinx}}}, like {{{html}}}, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
({{{pandoc}}} format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the {{{latex}}} format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After {{{#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")}}} one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
{{{#else}}} one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.

=== Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice ===

If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.


 # Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.
 # Go to the Sphinx directory and load the {{{conf.py}}} file into    a browser.
 # Search for "math" and comment out the    {{{'sphinx.ext.mathjax'}}} (enabled by default) and    {{{'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'}}} (disabled by default)    lines, and uncomment the {{{'sphinx.ext.pngmath'}}} package.    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures    of the mathematics.
 # Uncomment the line with {{{pngmath_dvipng_args =}}} and    set the PNG resolution to {{{-D 200}}} when the purpose is to    generate mathematics pictures for slides.
 # Run {{{make html}}}.
 # Look at the HTML source file in the {{{_build/html}}}    directory: all mathematics are in {{{img}}} tags with {{{src=}}}    pointing to a PNG file and {{{alt=}}} pointing to the LaTeX    source for the formula in question. This makes it very    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular    mathematical expression.


== Macros (Newcommands) ==

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style //newcommand//
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
{{{newcommand_replace.tex}}} are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names {{{newcommands.tex}}} and
{{{newcommands_keep.tex}}} are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
{{{!bt}}} and {{{!et}}} in {{{newcommands_keep.tex}}} to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
{{{newcommands_replace.tex}}} and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the {{{newcommands*.tex}}} files //must// appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

//Example.// Suppose we have the following commands in
{{{newcommand_replace.tex}}}:

{{{
\newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
\newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
\newcommand{\Q}{\pmb{Q}}
}}}

and these in {{{newcommands_keep.tex}}}:

{{{
\newcommand{\x}{\pmb{x}}
\newcommand{\normalvec}{\pmb{n}}
\newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}
}}}

The LaTeX block
{{{
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
}}}
will then be rendered to
{{{
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
}}}
in the current format.


== Preprocessing Steps ==

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
([[http://code.google.com/p/preprocess]]) and mako
([[http://www.makotemplates.org/]]). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of {{{name=value}}} command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable {{{FORMAT}}}
defined as the desired output format of Doconce ({{{html}}}, {{{latex}}},
{{{plain}}}, {{{rst}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, {{{epydoc}}}, {{{st}}}).  It is then easy to test on
the value of {{{FORMAT}}} and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example:

{{{
# If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
# PostScript files are used.

# #if FORMAT == "latex"
# Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
\begin{figure}
label{fig:wavepackets}
  \begin{center}
#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
#  #endif

#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}

Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats].

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.


== Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces ==

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form {{{#include "file.do.txt"}}}.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate {{{.rst}}} files and an index file listing the various {{{.rst}}}
that build up the document. To generate the various {{{.rst}}} files one
should not run Doconce on the individual {{{.do.txt}}} files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script {{{doconce split_rst}}}
to split the long, complete {{{.rst}}} into pieces. This process requires
that each {{{#include "file.do.txt}}} line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax {{{#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>}}}, where
{{{file}}} is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword {{{part:}}}.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is {{{master.do.txt}}}.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run
{{{
doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake_sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi
}}}
The autogenerated {{{automake_sphinx.sh}}} file (by {{{doconce sphinx_dir}}})
is compatible with a master {{{.rst}}} file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to {{{doconce sphinx_dir}}}.
This set is the output of {{{doconce split_rst}}}, which we catch in a
variable {{{files}}} above.


== Missing Features ==

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line

{{{
# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
# insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
# #else
# insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
# #endif
}}}

Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say
{{{
# table of contents
}}}
we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce {{{doconce format latex mydoc}}} to produce {{{mydoc.p.tex}}}. Then
we use the {{{doconce replace}}} and {{{doconce subst}}} commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:
{{{
Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
}}}
The {{{doconce replace from_text to_text filename}}} command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the {{{replace}}} method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with {{{\tableofcontents}}}, we should use {{{doconce subst}}},
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:
{{{
Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
}}}
Note the double backshlash in front of the {{{t}}} character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The {{{doconce subst}}} is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.


== Header and Footer ==

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if {{{TITLE:}}} or
{{{#TITLE:}}} is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


== Emacs Doconce Formatter ==

The file {{{misc/.doconce-mode.el}}} in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

//Step 1.// Download the Doconce tarball from {{{code.google.com/p/doconce}}},
pack it out and go to the root directory.

//Step 2.// Copy the {{{doconce-mode.el}}} file to the home directory:
{{{
cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME
}}}

//Step 3.// Add these lines to {{{$HOME/.emacs}}}:
{{{
(load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
(setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))
}}}
Emacs will now recognize files with extension {{{.do.txt}}} and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.



= Troubleshooting =


== Disclaimer ==

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running {{{doconce format}}}, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


== General Problems ==

=== Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step ===

Doconce automatically removes the file {{{__tmp.do.txt}}}, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when {{{mako}}} and/or
{{{preprocess}}} is run). Add the {{{--debug}}} flag at the end of the
{{{doconce}}} command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
{{{__tmp.do.txt}}} is deleted.

=== Figure captions are incomplete ===

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as //one line//, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

=== Preprocessor directives do not work ===

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

=== Problems with boldface and emphasize ===

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

=== Links to local directories do not work ===

Links of the type
{{{
see the "examples directory": "src/examples"
}}}
do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file:
{{{
see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"
}}}

=== Links are not typeset correctly ===

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim:
{{{
see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".
}}}
However, the following will not be typeset correctly:
{{{
see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"
}}}
The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.

=== Inline verbatim code is not detected ===

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

=== Strange non-English characters ===

Check the encoding of the {{{.do.txt}}} file with the Unix {{{file}}} command
or with
{{{
Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
}}}
If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands
{{{
Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt

Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
}}}

=== Wrong Norwegian charcters ===

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run {{{doconce change_encoding}}} to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

=== Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly ===

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

=== Too short underlining of reST headlines ===

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.

=== Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG) ===

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first {{{!bt}}} (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).


== Problems with code or Tex Blocks ==

=== Code or math block errors in reST ===

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a {{{!bc}}}, which should have been removed when
running {{{doconce format sphinx}}}, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then {{{!bc}}} will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

=== Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST ===

If {{{idx}}} commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

=== Something is wrong with a verbatim code block ===

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

=== Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format ===

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before {{{!bt}}} and {{{!bc}}} environments.

=== Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly ===

Read the the section [#Blocks_of_Verbatim_Computer_Code] above.  Start the
{{{!bc}}} and {{{!ec}}} tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

=== LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly ===

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the {{{!bt}}} and {{{!et}}} tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


== Problems with reST/Sphinx Output ==

=== Lists do not appear in .rst files ===

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

=== Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST ===

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

=== Warning about duplicate link names ===

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

=== Inconsistent headings in reST ===

The {{{rst2*.py}}} and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for {{{===}}},
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

=== No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks ===

The {{{!bc ipy}}} directive behaves this way for {{{sphinx}}} output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to {{{!bc cod}}} or another specification of the
verbatim environment.


== Problems with LaTeX Output ==

=== Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed ===

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the {{{-shell-escape}}} command-line argument when
running {{{latex}}} or {{{pdflatex}}}:
{{{
Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
}}}
Using {{{doconce ptex2tex}}} will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using {{{ptex2tex}}} requires the
preprocessor option {{{-DMINTED}}} to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, {{{latex}}} or {{{pdflatex}}} runs the
{{{pygmentize}}} program and the {{{shell-escape}}} option is required.

=== How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments? ===

Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via {{{doconce replace}}}. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code:

{{{
<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.
}}}
The {{{.p.tex}}} output file now reads
{{{
% begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
}}}
Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the {{{% begin ...}}} and {{{% end ...}}} lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the {{{.p.tex}}} file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with //Theorem//.
The following Bash script does the job:
{{{
file=mydoc.p.tex
thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file
}}}
More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
{{{mydoc.p.tex}}} file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting {{{mydoc.tex}}} file now becomes
{{{
\usepackage{theorem}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]

...

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
}}}
Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the {{{ptex2tex}}} program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).

=== The LaTeX file does not compile ===

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
{{{
\code{...}
}}}
the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

=== Inline verbatim gives error ===

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.,
{{{
some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
then replace this by
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
capture the second }
}}}
The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.

<wiki:comment> Could have doconce configure file where inline verbatim is </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> configured to be \fontsize... directly, not via ptex2tex \code{}. </wiki:comment>

=== Errors in figure captions ===

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper {{{texttt}}} command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

=== Chapters are ignored ===

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run {{{ptex2tex}}} with the option {{{-DBOOK}}} to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

=== I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file ===

The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:


# Make a little Bash script that performs a series of   {{{doconce subst}}} (regular expressions) or {{{doconce replace}}} (regular text)   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).
# Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This   means that the {{{doconce format latex}}} command does not generate   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these   files.   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro   text and include the various text pieces in this file.   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.


== Problems with gwiki Output ==

=== Strange nested lists in gwiki ===

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the {{{.gwiki}}} file directly.

=== Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source ===

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.


== Problems with HTML Output ==

=== How can I change the layout of the HTML page? ===

The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out {{{TITLE:}}} to get HTML without a header and footer). The
{{{--html-template=filename}}} command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title ({{{%(title)s}}}),
a date ({{{%(date)s}}}), and the main body of text ({{{%(main)s}}}).
For typesetting code, {{{pygments}}} is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by {{{--no-pygments-html}}} (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the {{{sphinx}}} format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via {{{doconce replace}}} and
{{{doconce subst}}} in the script that generates the final documents).

=== Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates? ===

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script:

{{{
doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
 '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
 '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html
}}}


== Debugging ==

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
{{{_doconce_debugging.log}}}, if the to {{{doconce format}}} after the filename
is {{{debug}}}. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



= Basic Parsing Ideas =

<wiki:comment> avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea) </wiki:comment>

The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression

{{{
(?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?
}}}

That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


== Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables ==

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and //placed at the end of
the doc string//. Note that {{{argument}}}, {{{keyword argument}}}, {{{return}}},
{{{instance variable}}}, {{{class variable}}}, and {{{module variable}}} are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.

{{{
    - argument x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
    - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
    - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
    - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
    - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
      (bool variable).
}}}

The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.


    * //module variable// x:  
      x value (float),      which must be a positive number.
    * //module variable// tolerance:  
      tolerance (float) for stopping      the iterations.

TITLE: Doconce Description
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Simula Research Laboratory, and University of Oslo)DATE: today

What Is Doconce?

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via 'rst2*' programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via 'unoconv') to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.
 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  - Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  - Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  - Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.
  - Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  - Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  - Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  - Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  - Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  - Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.

Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies

Doconce

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at "http://code.google.com/p/doconce":http://code.google.com/p/doconce.  Its installation from the
Mercurial ('hg') source follows the standard procedure::


        # Doconce
        hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version::


        cd doconce
        hg pull
        hg update
        sudo python setup.py install


Debian GNU/Linux users can also run::


        sudo apt-get install doconce

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run::


        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install doconce


Dependencies

Preprocessors

If you make use of the "http://code.google.com/p/preprocess":Preprocess
preprocessor, this program must be installed::


        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
"http://www.makotemplates.org":Mako. Its installation is most
conveniently done by 'pip',

!bc sys
        pip install Mako

This command requires 'pip' to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by::


        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the 'pip' "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip":source code.

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex":ptex2tex,
which is installed by::


        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, 'cp2texmf.sh':

!bc sys
        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that 'ptex2tex' potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by::


        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the '~/texmf/tex/latex/misc' directory).

Note that the 'doconce ptex2tex' command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the 'ptex2tex'
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by 'ptex2tex' and 'doconce ptext2tex'
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package "http://pygments.org":Pygments
to be installed::


        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install


If you use the minted style together with 'ptex2tex', you have to
enable it by the '-DMINTED' command-line argument to 'ptex2tex'.  All
use of the minted style requires the '-shell-escape' command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., 'latex -shell-escape' or 'pdflatex
-shell-escape'.

reStructuredText (reST) Output

The 'rst' output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the "http://docutils.sourceforge.net":docutils package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by::


        svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install::


        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths


There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
"http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf":rst2pdf. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the 'rst2pdf' directory and
run the usual 'sudo python setup.py install'.


Output to 'sphinx' requires of course "http://sphinx.pocoo.org":Sphinx,
installed by::


        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


Markdown and Pandoc Output

The Doconce format 'pandoc' outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the 'pandoc' program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/":Pandoc, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by::


        sudo apt-get install pandoc


Epydoc Output

When the output format is 'epydoc' one needs that program too, installed
by::


        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..


*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
'apt-get install' command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For 'svn' directories, go to the directory,
run 'svn update', and then 'sudo python setup.py install'. For
Mercurial ('hg') directories, go to the directory, run
'hg pull; hg update', and then 'sudo python setup.py install'.

Demos

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the::


        docs/manual/manual.do.txt

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
"https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html":demo web page
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file 'make.sh' in the same directory as the 'manual.do.txt' file
(the current text) shows how to run 'doconce format' on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

In the 'tutorial' directory there is also a 'make.sh' file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
"https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html":web demo
of the results.

From Doconce to Other Formats

Transformation of a Doconce document 'mydoc.do.txt' to various other
formats applies the script 'doconce format':
!bc sys
        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The 'mako' or 'preprocess' programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to 'mako' or 'preprocess' can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable 'FORMAT' is always defined as the current format when
running 'preprocess'. That is, in the last example, 'FORMAT' is
defined as 'latex'. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like '#if FORMAT == "latex"'.

The command-line arguments '--no-preprocess' and '--no-mako' turn off
running 'preprocess' and 'mako', respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

HTML

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file 'mydoc.do.txt'
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file 'mydoc.html' can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the 'pygmentize' program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument '--no-pygments-html'
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain '<pre>' HTML tags. The option '--pygments-html-linenos' turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": '%(title)s' for a title,
'%(date)s' for a date, and '%(main)s' for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
'DATE:' line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert '%(title)s' and
'%(date)s' at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by '%(main)s'. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html


Pandoc and Markdown

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is 'mydoc.mkd'.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats::


        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd

Pandoc supports 'latex', 'html', 'odt' (OpenOffice), 'docx' (Microsoft
Word), 'rtf', 'texinfo', to mention some. The '-R' option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the '--toc' option generates a table of contents.
See the "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html":Pandoc documentation
for the many features of the 'pandoc' program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
'doconce format pandoc' and then translating using 'pandoc', or
'doconce format latex', and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using 'pandoc'.
Here is an example on the latter strategy::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through 'pandoc', only single equations or 'align*'
environments are well understood.

Quite some 'doconce replace' and 'doconce subst' edits might be needed
on the '.mkd' or '.tex' files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd

The '-s' option adds a proper header and footer to the 'mydoc.html' file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.

LaTeX

Making a LaTeX file 'mydoc.tex' from 'mydoc.do.txt' is done in two steps:

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form 'mydoc.p.tex' for
the 'ptex2tex' program (or 'doconce ptex2tex')::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files 'newcommands.tex', 'newcommands_keep.tex', or
'newcommands_replace.tex' (see the section "Macros (Newcommands)").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run 'ptex2tex' (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have 'ptex2tex', you may run a (very) simplified version::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc


Note that Doconce generates a '.p.tex' file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through '-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional'.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
'-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage'.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 - 'BOOK' for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 - 'PALATINO' for the Palatino font
 - 'HELVETIA' for the Helvetica font
 - 'A4PAPER' for A4 paper size
 - 'A6PAPER' for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 - 'MOVIE15' for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 - 'PREAMBLE' to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)
 - 'MINTED' for inclusion of the minted package (which requires 'latex'
   or 'pdflatex' to be run with the '-shell-escape' option)

The 'ptex2tex' tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any '!bc' command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your '.ptex2tex.cfg'
file, e.g., '!bc sys' for a terminal session, where 'sys' is set to
a certain environment in '.ptex2tex.cfg' (e.g., 'CodeTerminal').
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the 'doconce ptex2tex' command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the '.p.tex' file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
                  -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that '@' must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as 'minted'
above, which implies '\begin{minted}{fortran}' and '\end{minted}' as
begin and end for blocks inside '!bc fpro' and '!ec').  Specifying
'envir=ans:nt' means that all other environments are typeset with the
'anslistings.sty' package, e.g., '!bc cppcod' will then result in
'\begin{c++}'. If no environments like 'sys', 'fpro', or the common
'envir' are defined on the command line, the plain '\begin{verbatim}'
and '\end{verbatim}' used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the 'mydoc.tex' file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute 'section' by 'section*' to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the 'doconce replace' and 'doconce subst'
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples::


        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile 'mydoc.tex'
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc


If one wishes to run 'ptex2tex' and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks ('Minted_Python', 'Minted_Cpp', etc., in
'ptex2tex' specified through the '*pro' and '*cod' variables in
'.ptex2tex.cfg' or '$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg'), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running 'ptex2tex' with the
'-DMINTED' option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, 'latex' must be run with the
'-shell-escape' option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

When running 'doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted' (or other minted
specifications with 'doconce ptex2tex'), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the '-DMINTED' option.

PDFLaTeX

Running 'pdflatex' instead of 'latex' follows almost the same steps,
but the start is::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then 'ptex2tex' is run as explained above, and finally::


        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc


Plain ASCII Text

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file 'mydoc.rst':
!bc sys
        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice


The OpenOffice file 'mydoc.odt' can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program 'unovonv'
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run::


        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
'mydoc.odt' to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF::


        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt


*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by 'latex' as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the 'sphinx' output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the 'doconce sphinx_dir' command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords 'author', 'title', and 'version' are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, 'version' is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files 'file1',
'file2', etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files 'file1', 'file2', etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of 'dirname' is 'sphinx-rootdir'. The 'theme'
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ''default'').

With a single-file document in 'mydoc.do.txt' one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory 'sphinx-rootdir' is made with
relevant files.

The 'doconce sphinx_dir' command generates a script
'automake_sphinx.py' for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run 'automake_sphinx.py' or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The 'doconce sphinx_dir' script copies directories named 'figs' or
'figures' over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, 'automake_sphinx.py' must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not 'http:' or 'file:' URLs), must be
placed in the '_static' subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility 'doconce sphinxfix_localURLs' is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say 'dir1/dir2/myfile.txt' it
replaces the link by '_static/myfile.txt' and copies
'dir1/dir2/myfile.txt' to a local '_static' directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in '_static' or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all '_static/*' files to the
'_static' subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a '_static' or '_static-name' directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the 'conf.py'
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
'make-themes.sh' can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes 'fenics' and 'pyramid', one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are '_build/html_fenics'
and '_build/html_pyramid', respectively. Without arguments,
'make-themes.sh' makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file 'mydoc.do.txt'.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive 'sphinx-quickstart'
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated 'conf.py' file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The 'doconce sphinx_dir' generator makes an extended 'conv.py'
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the 'mydoc.rst' file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with 'mydoc.rst' in the 'sphinx-rootdir'
directory. Either edit 'mydoc.rst' so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to 'sphinx-rootdir'.
Links to local files in 'mydoc.rst' must be modified to links to
files in the '_static' directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated 'index.rst' file so that 'mydoc.rst'
is included, i.e., add 'mydoc' to the 'toctree' section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before 'mydoc' are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with 'index.html' files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows '!bc': 'cod' gives Python
('code-block:: python' in Sphinx syntax) and 'cppcod' gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

Wiki Formats

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
"http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax":Googlecode wiki, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
'gwiki', 'mwiki', and 'cwiki', respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt


The Googlecode wiki document, 'mydoc.gwiki', is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the '.gwiki' file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of "http://pediapress.com/code/":mwlib. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write "http://en.wikibooks.org":Wikibooks
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.

Tweaking the Doconce Output

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
'.rst' file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if '.eps' or '.png' is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The 'make.sh' files in 'docs/manual' and 'docs/tutorial'
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

The Doconce Markup Language

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

Lists

An unordered bullet list makes use of the '*' as bullet sign
and is indented as follows::


           * item 1
        
           * item 2
        
             * subitem 1, if there are more
               lines, each line must
               be intended as shown here
        
             * subitem 2,
               also spans two lines
        
           * item 3


This list gets typeset as

   - item 1
   - item 2
     - subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here
     - subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   - item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an 'o' (as the first letter
in "ordered")::


           o item 1
        
           o item 2
        
             * subitem 1
        
             * subitem 2
        
           o item 3


resulting in

  1. item 1
  2. item 2
     - subitem 1
     - subitem 2

  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon::


           - keyword1: explanation of keyword1
        
           - keyword2: explanation
             of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
             if there are multiple
             lines)


The result becomes

   keyword1: --  
     explanation of keyword1
   keyword2: --  
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)

Special Lines

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with 'TITLE:', 'AUTHOR:', and 'DATE:' are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax::


        name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3

The 'at' with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the 'and' with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax::


        name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2

Multiple authors require multiple 'AUTHOR:' lines. All information
associated with 'TITLE:' and 'AUTHOR:' keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: November 9, 2016

Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including 'rst' and 'sphinx')
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format::


        Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
        Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
        A. Dummy Author
        
        [1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
        [2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
        [3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as 'today'.


*Table of Contents.* A table of contents can be generated by the line::


        TOC: on

This line is usually placed after the 'DATE:' line.
A value 'off' turns off the table of contents.


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   - 9 '=' characters for chapters
   - 7 for sections
   - 5 for subsections
   - 3 for subsubsections
   - 2 *underscrores* (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
*must* be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples::


        __Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
        various section headings.
        
        ========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========
        
        Some text.
        
        
        ======= Example on a Section Heading =======
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        
        ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        __A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.


Special Lines

Figures

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax::


        FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption
        

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say '.eps' when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's 'convert' utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for 'TITLE:' and 'AUTHOR:' lines, all information
related to a figure line *must be written on the same line*. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as 'FIGURE:' will be
included in the formatted caption).

FIGURE:[figs/streamtubes, width=400] Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. {fig:viz}

Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
'montage' program from the ImageMagick suite::


        montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
                file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png

The option '-tile XxY' gives 'X' figures in the horizontal direction and
'Y' in the vertical direction ('tile 2x' means two figures per row
and '-tile x2' means two rows).

Movies

Here is an example on the 'MOVIE:' keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the 'latex', 'html', 'rst', and 'sphinx' formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie::


        MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption
        



 (Movie figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play "mjolnir.html":mjolnir.html)



The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the 'movie15' package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable 'MOVIE15'. There is an associated variable
'EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER' which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader)::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc


The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
'myframes*.png'. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the 'MOVIE:' command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).

Copying Computer Code from Source Files

Another type of special lines starts with '@@@CODE' and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" below.

Inline Tagging

Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, **boldface phrases**,
and 'verbatim text' (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x).

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in::


        *emphasized words*


Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk::


        _several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

The line above gets typeset as
**several words in boldface** followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks::


        `call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
        while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

The typesetting result looks like this:
'call myroutine(a, b)' looks like a Fortran call
while 'void myfunc(double *a, double *b)' must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and 'ptex2tex') will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as::


        some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"

which appears as some URL like "http://google.com":Search Google.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in '.txt', '.html', '.pdf', '.py', '.f',
'.f77', '.f90', '.f95', '.sh', '.csh', '.ksh', '.zsh',
'.c', '.cpp', '.cxx', '.pl', and '.java' follows the same
setup::


        see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".

which appears as see the "manual.do.txt":Doconce Manual.
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:

  - In the 'html' format the links work well if the files are
    supplied with the '.html' with the same relative location.
  - In the 'latex' and 'pdflatex' formats, such links in PDF files
    will unless the '.tex' file has a full URL specified through
    a '\hyperbaseurl' command and the linked files are located correctly
    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.
  - In the 'sphinx' format, local files to which there are links should only be
    located in a '_static' or '_static-name' subdirectory.

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a '_static' or '_static-name' directory and makes links to
files in this directory only ('name' is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the 'html' format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
'pygmentize', e.g.::


        Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
                  -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh

Then you can link to '_static/make.sh.html' instead of
'subdir/make.sh'. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as 'src/myprog.py' in her
software and the document links to '_static/myprog.py':
!bc
        See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").


Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
*the filename as link text*. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes::


        URL: "manual.html"

resulting in the link "manual.html":manual.html.


Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes::


        Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

resulting in Click on this link: "http://code.google.com/p/doconce":http://code.google.com/p/doconce.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text::


        [name: comment]

where 'name' is the name of the author of the command, and 'comment' is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless 'doconce format'
is run with a command-line argument '--skip_inline_comments'
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the '.do.txt' file
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats").

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII::


        Here is an example on a linear system
        ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
        where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
        $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support ('latex', 'pdflatex', 'html',
'sphinx', 'mwiki'), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system Ax=b, where A
is an nxn matrix, and x and b
are vectors of length n."

Comments

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as *inline comments* in Doconce and described
in the section "Inline Tagging".

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash '#':
!bc
        #
        # Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
        # These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
        #

Such comment lines may have some side effects in the 'rst' and 'sphinx'
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out *before*
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash '##' and lines enclosed by
the '<%doc>' (beginning) and '<%doc/>' (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.

Cross-Referencing

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple::


        label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
        For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
'rst' and 'sphinx' formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by 'doconce format'. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure ref{fig:viz}
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections "LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text" and "Macros (Newcommands)" are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section "Inline Tagging".

Index and Bibliography

An index can be created for the 'latex', 'rst', and 'sphinx' formats
by the 'idx' keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax::


        idx{some index entry}
        idx{main entry!subentry}
        idx{`verbatim_text` and more}

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to::


        \index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: 'idx'
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style::


        as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding 'cite' command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like::


        as found in [3][14]

if 'Larsen_1986' has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and 'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999' is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword 'BIBFILE:',
followed by a BibTeX file with extension '.bib',
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension '.rst',
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension '.py'.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.::


        {
        'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
        K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
        URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
        """,
        'Larsen_1986':
        """
        O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
        *Personal Press*. 1986.
        """
        }


In the 'latex' and 'pdflatex' formats, the '.bib' file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the 'rst' and 'sphinx' formats, the
'.rst' file will be copied into the document at the place where the
'BIBFILE:' keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the 'BIBFILE:' line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is 'myfile.bib'.
Insert 'BIBFILE: myfile.bib' at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the '.rst' file, either by manual editing
of 'myfile.bbl' or using 'doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl' to automate (most of)
this editing. From the 'myfile.rst' file it is easy to create 'myfile.py'
with the dictionary version of the references.


Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/":bibliograph.parsing tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [1], a paper [2],
and both of them simultaneously [1] [2].

[somereader: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) ]

Tables

A table like

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters 'c', 'r', or 'l' to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes '|' can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables ('rst' and 'sphinx' are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.

Exercises, Problems, or Projects

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
*exercise*, *problem*, or *project*.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 '=' characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this::


        ===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{proj:moondist}
        file=earth2moon.pdf
        solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt
        
        Here goes the running text of the project....
        

Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project *title*,
the *label*, the *result file*, the *solution* (if any of
these three entities is present), and the *running text*. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with '!bsubex' and ending
with '!esubex', on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) *answer*, and *hints*. The environments have begin-end
directives '!bans', '!eans', '!bsol', '!esol', '!bhint', '!ehint', which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
'!bc' and '!ec').

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the 'solution=...' directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        file=earth2moon.pdf
        
        Here goes the running text of the project....
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        !esubex


The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file '.mydoc.exerinfo',
if 'mydoc.do.txt' is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The *title* is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem ref{...}"
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".

Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" '!bc' keyword and an "end code" '!ec' keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the '!bc' tag to specify a
certain environment (for 'ptex2tex' or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, '!bc dat' corresponds to
the data file environment and '!bc cod' is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for 'ptex2tex' this means the 'ccq' environment,
which is defined in the config file '.ptex2tex.cfg',
while for Sphinx it defaults to the 'python' environment).

Since the config file for 'ptex2tex' can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after '!bc' is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

Here, three arguments are defined: 'pycod' for Python code,
'cod' also for Python code, 'cppcod' for C++ code, and 'sys'
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in '.ptex2tex.cfg' for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, 'pro' is used for complete programs in Python, 'cod' is
for a code snippet in Python, while 'xcod' and 'xpro' implies computer
language specific typesetting where 'x' can be 'f' for Fortran, 'c'
for C, 'cpp' for C++, 'sh' for Unix shells, 'pl' for Perl, 'm' for
Matlab, 'cy' for Cython, and 'py' for Python.  The argument 'sys'
means by default 'console' for Sphinx and 'CodeTerminal' (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are 'dat' for a data file
or print out, and 'ipy' for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in 'sphinx' output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after '!bc' can be redefined in the
'.ptex2tex.cfg' configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
'sphinx code-blocks' comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.


The enclosing '!ec' tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code ('pycod' style)::


        # regular expressions for inline tags:
        inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
        inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
        INLINE_TAGS = {
            'emphasize':
            r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'verbatim':
            r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'bold':
            r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
        }

And here is a C++ code snippet ('cppcod' style)::


        void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
            for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
                myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
            }
        }


Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then::


         @@@CODE myfile.f
         @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

The first line implies that all lines in the file 'myfile.f' are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a '!bc Xpro' environment, where
'X' is the extension of the filename, here 'f' (i.e., the environment
becomes '!bc fpro' and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a 'fromto:' directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, 'X' is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the 'pro' and 'cod' arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain '!bc' environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
'@' sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching 'subroutine test'
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching 'C END1' (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above)::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the 'fromto:'
directive above::


              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return


Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing 'fromto:' by
'from-to' ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text::


        # --- Start Example 1 ---
        c = -1
        A = 2
        p0 = 4
        simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
        # --- End Example 1 ---
        
        # --- Start Example 2 ---
        c = -1
        A = 1
        p0 = 0
        simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
        # --- End Example 2 ---

is easy with::


        from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2

With only 'fromto:' this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with 'ptex2tex': The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in 'ptex2tex'. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
'.p.tex' file to be treated by 'ptex2tex'. However, the '@@@CODE' line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the 'ptex2tex' configuration
file.)

LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is '!bt' (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
'!et'. It is important that '!bt' and '!et' appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline::


        !bt
        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}
        


Here is the result of the above '!bt' - '!et' block::

        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}


The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
'latex' and 'pdflatex' has of course full support. The 'html' format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although 'sphinx', like 'html', employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
('pandoc' format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the 'latex' format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After '#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")' one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
'#else' one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.

Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice

If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.

 1. Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.
 2. Go to the Sphinx directory and load the 'conf.py' file into
    a browser.
 3. Search for "math" and comment out the
    ''sphinx.ext.mathjax'' (enabled by default) and
    ''matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'' (disabled by default)
    lines, and uncomment the ''sphinx.ext.pngmath'' package.
    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures
    of the mathematics.
 4. Uncomment the line with 'pngmath_dvipng_args =' and
    set the PNG resolution to '-D 200' when the purpose is to
    generate mathematics pictures for slides.
 5. Run 'make html'.
 6. Look at the HTML source file in the '_build/html'
    directory: all mathematics are in 'img' tags with 'src='
    pointing to a PNG file and 'alt=' pointing to the LaTeX
    source for the formula in question. This makes it very
    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular
    mathematical expression.

Macros (Newcommands)

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
'newcommand_replace.tex' are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names 'newcommands.tex' and
'newcommands_keep.tex' are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
'!bt' and '!et' in 'newcommands_keep.tex' to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
'newcommands_replace.tex' and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the 'newcommands*.tex' files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
'newcommand_replace.tex':

!bc pro
        \newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
        \newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
        \newcommand{\Q}{\pmb{Q}}


and these in 'newcommands_keep.tex':

!bc pro
        \newcommand{\x}{\pmb{x}}
        \newcommand{\normalvec}{\pmb{n}}
        \newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}


The LaTeX block::


        \beqa
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   label{my:eq2}
        \eeqa

will then be rendered to::

        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}

in the current format.

Preprocessing Steps

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
("http://code.google.com/p/preprocess":http://code.google.com/p/preprocess) and mako
("http://www.makotemplates.org/":http://www.makotemplates.org/). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of 'name=value' command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable 'FORMAT'
defined as the desired output format of Doconce ('html', 'latex',
'plain', 'rst', 'sphinx', 'epydoc', 'st').  It is then easy to test on
the value of 'FORMAT' and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example::


        # If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
        # PostScript files are used.
        
        # #if FORMAT == "latex"
        # Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
        \begin{figure}
        label{fig:wavepackets}
          \begin{center}
        #  #ifdef PNGFIGS
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
        #  #else
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
        #  #endif
        
        #  #ifdef PNGFIGS
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
        #  #else
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
        #  #endif
          \end{center}
          \caption{
          Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
          }
        \end{figure}
        
        # #else
        
        # Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats
        
        FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.
        
        FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.
        
        # #endif


Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section "From Doconce to Other Formats".

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.

Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form '#include "file.do.txt"'.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate '.rst' files and an index file listing the various '.rst'
that build up the document. To generate the various '.rst' files one
should not run Doconce on the individual '.do.txt' files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script 'doconce split_rst'
to split the long, complete '.rst' into pieces. This process requires
that each '#include "file.do.txt' line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax '#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>', where
'file' is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword 'part:'.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is 'master.do.txt'.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run::


        doconce format sphinx master
        # Split master.rst into parts
        # as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
        files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`
        
        dir=sphinxm-rootdir
        
        if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
          doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
                  version=1.0 theme=default $files
          sh automake_sphinx.sh
        else
          for file in $files; do
            cp $file.rst $dir
          done
          cd $dir
          make html
          cd ..
        fi

The autogenerated 'automake_sphinx.sh' file (by 'doconce sphinx_dir')
is compatible with a master '.rst' file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to 'doconce sphinx_dir'.
This set is the output of 'doconce split_rst', which we catch in a
variable 'files' above.

Missing Features

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line::


        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        # insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
        # #else
        # insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
        # #endif


Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say::


        # table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce 'doconce format latex mydoc' to produce 'mydoc.p.tex'. Then
we use the 'doconce replace' and 'doconce subst' commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter::


        Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
                  '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

The 'doconce replace from_text to_text filename' command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the 'replace' method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with '\tableofcontents', we should use 'doconce subst',
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character::


        Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
                  '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

Note the double backshlash in front of the 't' character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The 'doconce subst' is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

Header and Footer

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if 'TITLE:' or
'#TITLE:' is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.

Emacs Doconce Formatter

The file 'misc/.doconce-mode.el' in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

*Step 1.* Download the Doconce tarball from 'code.google.com/p/doconce',
pack it out and go to the root directory.

*Step 2.* Copy the 'doconce-mode.el' file to the home directory::


        cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME


*Step 3.* Add these lines to '$HOME/.emacs':
!bc
        (load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
        (setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))

Emacs will now recognize files with extension '.do.txt' and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.

Troubleshooting

Disclaimer

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running 'doconce format', the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.

General Problems

Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step

Doconce automatically removes the file '__tmp.do.txt', which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when 'mako' and/or
'preprocess' is run). Add the '--debug' flag at the end of the
'doconce' command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
'__tmp.do.txt' is deleted.

Figure captions are incomplete

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

Preprocessor directives do not work

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

Problems with boldface and emphasize

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

Links to local directories do not work

Links of the type::


        see the "examples directory": "src/examples"

do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file::


        see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"


Links are not typeset correctly

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim::


        see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".

However, the following will not be typeset correctly::


        see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"

The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.

Inline verbatim code is not detected

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

Strange non-English characters

Check the encoding of the '.do.txt' file with the Unix 'file' command
or with::


        Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands::


        Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
        
        Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile


Wrong Norwegian charcters

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run 'doconce change_encoding' to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

Too short underlining of reST headlines

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.

Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG)

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first '!bt' (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

Problems with code or Tex Blocks

Code or math block errors in reST

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a '!bc', which should have been removed when
running 'doconce format sphinx', it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then '!bc' will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST

If 'idx' commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

Something is wrong with a verbatim code block

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before '!bt' and '!bc' environments.

Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly

Read the the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" above.  Start the
'!bc' and '!ec' tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the '!bt' and '!et' tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.

Problems with reST/Sphinx Output

Lists do not appear in .rst files

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

Warning about duplicate link names

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

Inconsistent headings in reST

The 'rst2*.py' and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for '===',
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks

The '!bc ipy' directive behaves this way for 'sphinx' output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to '!bc cod' or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

Problems with LaTeX Output

Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the '-shell-escape' command-line argument when
running 'latex' or 'pdflatex':
!bc sys
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex

Using 'doconce ptex2tex' will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using 'ptex2tex' requires the
preprocessor option '-DMINTED' to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, 'latex' or 'pdflatex' runs the
'pygmentize' program and the 'shell-escape' option is required.

How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments?

Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via 'doconce replace'. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code::


        <%
        theorem_counter = 4
        %>
        
        # begin theorem
        label{theorem:fundamental1}
        <%
        theorem_counter += 1
        theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
        %>
        
        __Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        # end theorem
        
        # begin proof
        __Proof.__
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$|$END$
        # end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
        achievement.

The '.p.tex' output file now reads::


        % begin theorem
        label{theorem:fundamental1}
        
        
        \paragraph{Theorem 5.}
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        % end theorem
        
        % begin proof
        \paragraph{Proof.}
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$
        % end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
        achievement.

Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the '% begin ...' and '% end ...' lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the '.p.tex' file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with *Theorem*.
The following Bash script does the job::


        file=mydoc.p.tex
        thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
        doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
        doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
        doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
        doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file

More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
'mydoc.p.tex' file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting 'mydoc.tex' file now becomes::


        \usepackage{theorem}
        \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]
        
        ...
        
        \begin{theorem}
        \label{theorem:fundamental1}
        
        
        
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        \end{theorem}
        
        % begin proof
        \paragraph{Proof.}
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$
        % end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
        achievement.

Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the 'ptex2tex' program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).

The LaTeX file does not compile

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving::


        \code{...}

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

Inline verbatim gives error

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.::


        some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
        ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
        then replace this by
        {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
        which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
        capture the second }

The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.

Errors in figure captions

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper 'texttt' command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

Chapters are ignored

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run 'ptex2tex' with the option '-DBOOK' to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file

The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:

1. Make a little Bash script that performs a series of
   'doconce subst' (regular expressions) or 'doconce replace' (regular text)
   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to
   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).
2. Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate
   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then
   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This
   means that the 'doconce format latex' command does not generate
   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these
   files.
   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro
   text and include the various text pieces in this file.
   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files
   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the
   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but
   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.

Problems with gwiki Output

Strange nested lists in gwiki

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the '.gwiki' file directly.

Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

Problems with HTML Output

How can I change the layout of the HTML page?

The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out 'TITLE:' to get HTML without a header and footer). The
'--html-template=filename' command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title ('%(title)s'),
a date ('%(date)s'), and the main body of text ('%(main)s').
For typesetting code, 'pygments' is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by '--no-pygments-html' (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the 'sphinx' format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via 'doconce replace' and
'doconce subst' in the script that generates the final documents).

Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates?

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script::


        doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
         '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
        doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
         '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html


Debugging

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
'_doconce_debugging.log', if the to 'doconce format' after the filename
is 'debug'. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.

Basic Parsing Ideas

The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression::


        (?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?


That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.

Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that 'argument', 'keyword argument', 'return',
'instance variable', 'class variable', and 'module variable' are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted::


            - argument x: x value (float),
              which must be a positive number.
            - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
              the iterations.
            - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
            - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
            - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
            - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
              (bool variable).


The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    module variable x: --  
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    module variable tolerance: --  
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

TITLE: Doconce Description

What Is Doconce?
================


Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via C{rst2*} programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via C{unoconv}) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.
 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  - Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  - Doconce can be converted to plain I{untagged} text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  - Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.
  - Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  - Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  - Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  - Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  - Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  - Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies
============================================

Doconce
-------

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at U{http://code.google.com/p/doconce<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>}.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (C{hg}) source follows the standard procedure::


        # Doconce
        hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version::


        cd doconce
        hg pull
        hg update
        sudo python setup.py install


Debian GNU/Linux users can also run::


        sudo apt-get install doconce

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run::


        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install doconce


Dependencies
------------

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the U{Preprocess<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>}
preprocessor, this program must be installed::


        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
U{Mako<http://www.makotemplates.org>}. Its installation is most
conveniently done by C{pip}::


        pip install Mako

This command requires C{pip} to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by::


        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the C{pip} U{source code<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>}.

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need U{ptex2tex<http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>},
which is installed by::


        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, C{cp2texmf.sh}::


        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that C{ptex2tex} potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by::


        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the C{~/texmf/tex/latex/misc} directory).

Note that the C{doconce ptex2tex} command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the C{ptex2tex}
program.

The I{minted} LaTeX style is offered by C{ptex2tex} and C{doconce ptext2tex}
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package U{Pygments<http://pygments.org>}
to be installed::


        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install


If you use the minted style together with C{ptex2tex}, you have to
enable it by the C{-DMINTED} command-line argument to C{ptex2tex}.  All
use of the minted style requires the C{-shell-escape} command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., C{latex -shell-escape} or C{pdflatex
-shell-escape}.


reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The C{rst} output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the U{docutils<http://docutils.sourceforge.net>} package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by::


        svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install::


        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths


There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
U{rst2pdf<http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf>}. Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the C{rst2pdf} directory and
run the usual C{sudo python setup.py install}.


Output to C{sphinx} requires of course U{Sphinx<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>},
installed by::


        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce format C{pandoc} outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the C{pandoc} program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of U{Pandoc<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>}, written in Haskell, is most
easily done by::


        sudo apt-get install pandoc


Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is C{epydoc} one needs that program too, installed
by::


        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..


I{Remark.} Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
C{apt-get install} command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For C{svn} directories, go to the directory,
run C{svn update}, and then C{sudo python setup.py install}. For
Mercurial (C{hg}) directories, go to the directory, run
C{hg pull; hg update}, and then C{sudo python setup.py install}.




Demos
-----


The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the::


        docs/manual/manual.do.txt

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
U{demo web page<https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>}
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file C{make.sh} in the same directory as the C{manual.do.txt} file
(the current text) shows how to run C{doconce format} on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

In the C{tutorial} directory there is also a C{make.sh} file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
U{web demo<https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>}
of the results.



From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document C{mydoc.do.txt} to various other
formats applies the script C{doconce format}::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The C{mako} or C{preprocess} programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to C{mako} or C{preprocess} can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable C{FORMAT} is always defined as the current format when
running C{preprocess}. That is, in the last example, C{FORMAT} is
defined as C{latex}. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like C{#if FORMAT == "latex"}.

The command-line arguments C{--no-preprocess} and C{--no-mako} turn off
running C{preprocess} and C{mako}, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file C{mydoc.do.txt}
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file C{mydoc.html} can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the C{pygmentize} program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument C{--no-pygments-html}
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain C{<pre>} HTML tags. The option C{--pygments-html-linenos} turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": C{%(title)s} for a title,
C{%(date)s} for a date, and C{%(main)s} for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
C{DATE:} line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert C{%(title)s} and
C{%(date)s} at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by C{%(main)s}. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html


Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is C{mydoc.mkd}.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats::


        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd

Pandoc supports C{latex}, C{html}, C{odt} (OpenOffice), C{docx} (Microsoft
Word), C{rtf}, C{texinfo}, to mention some. The C{-R} option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the C{--toc} option generates a table of contents.
See the U{Pandoc documentation<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html>}
for the many features of the C{pandoc} program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
C{doconce format pandoc} and then translating using C{pandoc}, or
C{doconce format latex}, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using C{pandoc}.
Here is an example on the latter strategy::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through C{pandoc}, only single equations or C{align*}
environments are well understood.

Quite some C{doconce replace} and C{doconce subst} edits might be needed
on the C{.mkd} or C{.tex} files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd

The C{-s} option adds a proper header and footer to the C{mydoc.html} file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file C{mydoc.tex} from C{mydoc.do.txt} is done in two steps:

I{Step 1.} Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form C{mydoc.p.tex} for
the C{ptex2tex} program (or C{doconce ptex2tex})::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files C{newcommands.tex}, C{newcommands_keep.tex}, or
C{newcommands_replace.tex} (see the section "Macros (Newcommands)").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

I{Step 2.} Run C{ptex2tex} (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have C{ptex2tex}, you may run a (very) simplified version::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc


Note that Doconce generates a C{.p.tex} file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through C{-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional}.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
C{-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage}.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 - C{BOOK} for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)
 - C{PALATINO} for the Palatino font
 - C{HELVETIA} for the Helvetica font
 - C{A4PAPER} for A4 paper size
 - C{A6PAPER} for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)
 - C{MOVIE15} for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies
 - C{PREAMBLE} to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)
 - C{MINTED} for inclusion of the minted package (which requires C{latex}
   or C{pdflatex} to be run with the C{-shell-escape} option)

The C{ptex2tex} tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any C{!bc} command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your C{.ptex2tex.cfg}
file, e.g., C{!bc sys} for a terminal session, where C{sys} is set to
a certain environment in C{.ptex2tex.cfg} (e.g., C{CodeTerminal}).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the C{doconce ptex2tex} command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the C{.p.tex} file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
                  -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that C{@} must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as C{minted}
above, which implies C{\begin{minted}{fortran}} and C{\end{minted}} as
begin and end for blocks inside C{!bc fpro} and C{!ec}).  Specifying
C{envir=ans:nt} means that all other environments are typeset with the
C{anslistings.sty} package, e.g., C{!bc cppcod} will then result in
C{\begin{c++}}. If no environments like C{sys}, C{fpro}, or the common
C{envir} are defined on the command line, the plain C{\begin{verbatim}}
and C{\end{verbatim}} used.


I{Step 2b (optional).} Edit the C{mydoc.tex} file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute C{section} by C{section*} to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the C{doconce replace} and C{doconce subst}
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples::


        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

I{Step 3.} Compile C{mydoc.tex}
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc


If one wishes to run C{ptex2tex} and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (C{Minted_Python}, C{Minted_Cpp}, etc., in
C{ptex2tex} specified through the C{*pro} and C{*cod} variables in
C{.ptex2tex.cfg} or C{$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg}), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running C{ptex2tex} with the
C{-DMINTED} option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, C{latex} must be run with the
C{-shell-escape} option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

When running C{doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted} (or other minted
specifications with C{doconce ptex2tex}), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the C{-DMINTED} option.


PDFLaTeX
--------

Running C{pdflatex} instead of C{latex} follows almost the same steps,
but the start is::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then C{ptex2tex} is run as explained above, and finally::


        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file C{mydoc.rst}::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice


The OpenOffice file C{mydoc.odt} can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program C{unovonv}
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports I{on the command line}.
Run::


        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
C{mydoc.odt} to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF::


        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt


I{Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.} At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by C{latex} as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the C{sphinx} output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the C{doconce sphinx_dir} command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords C{author}, C{title}, and C{version} are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, C{version} is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files C{file1},
C{file2}, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files C{file1}, C{file2}, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of C{dirname} is C{sphinx-rootdir}. The C{theme}
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is C{'default'}).

With a single-file document in C{mydoc.do.txt} one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory C{sphinx-rootdir} is made with
relevant files.

The C{doconce sphinx_dir} command generates a script
C{automake_sphinx.py} for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run C{automake_sphinx.py} or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The C{doconce sphinx_dir} script copies directories named C{figs} or
C{figures} over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, C{automake_sphinx.py} must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not C{http:} or C{file:} URLs), must be
placed in the C{_static} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility C{doconce sphinxfix_localURLs} is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say C{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt} it
replaces the link by C{_static/myfile.txt} and copies
C{dir1/dir2/myfile.txt} to a local C{_static} directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in C{_static} or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all C{_static/*} files to the
C{_static} subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a C{_static} or C{_static-name} directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the C{conf.py}
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
C{make-themes.sh} can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes C{fenics} and C{pyramid}, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are C{_build/html_fenics}
and C{_build/html_pyramid}, respectively. Without arguments,
C{make-themes.sh} makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file C{mydoc.do.txt}.

I{Step 1.} Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


I{Step 2.} Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive C{sphinx-quickstart}
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated C{conf.py} file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The C{doconce sphinx_dir} generator makes an extended C{conv.py}
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


I{Step 3.} Copy the C{mydoc.rst} file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with C{mydoc.rst} in the C{sphinx-rootdir}
directory. Either edit C{mydoc.rst} so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to C{sphinx-rootdir}.
Links to local files in C{mydoc.rst} must be modified to links to
files in the C{_static} directory, see comment above.

I{Step 4.} Edit the generated C{index.rst} file so that C{mydoc.rst}
is included, i.e., add C{mydoc} to the C{toctree} section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before C{mydoc} are important!)

I{Step 5.} Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with C{index.html} files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

I{Step 6.} View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows C{!bc}: C{cod} gives Python
(C{code-block:: python} in Sphinx syntax) and C{cppcod} gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
U{Googlecode wiki<http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>}, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
C{gwiki}, C{mwiki}, and C{cwiki}, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt


The Googlecode wiki document, C{mydoc.gwiki}, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the C{.gwiki} file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of U{mwlib<http://pediapress.com/code/>}. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write U{Wikibooks<http://en.wikibooks.org>}
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
C{.rst} file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if C{.eps} or C{.png} is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The C{make.sh} files in C{docs/manual} and C{docs/tutorial}
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



The Doconce Markup Language
===========================

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

Lists
-----

An unordered bullet list makes use of the C{*} as bullet sign
and is indented as follows::


           * item 1
        
           * item 2
        
             * subitem 1, if there are more
               lines, each line must
               be intended as shown here
        
             * subitem 2,
               also spans two lines
        
           * item 3


This list gets typeset as

   - item 1
   - item 2
     - subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here
     - subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   - item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an C{o} (as the first letter
in "ordered")::


           o item 1
        
           o item 2
        
             * subitem 1
        
             * subitem 2
        
           o item 3


resulting in

  1. item 1
  2. item 2
     - subitem 1
     - subitem 2

  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon::


           - keyword1: explanation of keyword1
        
           - keyword2: explanation
             of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
             if there are multiple
             lines)


The result becomes

   - keyword1: 
     explanation of keyword1
   - keyword2: 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)

Special Lines
-------------

The Doconce markup language has a concept called I{special lines}.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


I{Heading with Title and Author(s).} Lines starting with C{TITLE:}, C{AUTHOR:}, and C{DATE:} are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax::


        name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3

The C{at} with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the C{and} with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax::


        name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2

Multiple authors require multiple C{AUTHOR:} lines. All information
associated with C{TITLE:} and C{AUTHOR:} keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: November 9, 2016

Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including C{rst} and C{sphinx})
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format::


        Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
        Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
        A. Dummy Author
        
        [1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
        [2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
        [3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as C{today}.


I{Table of Contents.} A table of contents can be generated by the line::


        TOC: on

This line is usually placed after the C{DATE:} line.
A value C{off} turns off the table of contents.


I{Section Headings.} Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   - 9 C{=} characters for chapters
   - 7 for sections
   - 5 for subsections
   - 3 for subsubsections
   - 2 I{underscrores} (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
I{must} be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples::


        __Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
        various section headings.
        
        ========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========
        
        Some text.
        
        
        ======= Example on a Section Heading =======
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        
        ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        __A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.


Special Lines
=============

Figures
-------


Figures are recognized by the special line syntax::


        FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption
        

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say C{.eps} when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's C{convert} utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for C{TITLE:} and C{AUTHOR:} lines, all information
related to a figure line I{must be written on the same line}. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as C{FIGURE:} will be
included in the formatted caption).

FIGURE:[figs/streamtubes, width=400] Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. {fig:viz}

Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
C{montage} program from the ImageMagick suite::


        montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
                file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png

The option C{-tile XxY} gives C{X} figures in the horizontal direction and
C{Y} in the vertical direction (C{tile 2x} means two figures per row
and C{-tile x2} means two rows).

Movies
------

Here is an example on the C{MOVIE:} keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the C{latex}, C{html}, C{rst}, and C{sphinx} formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie::


        MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption
        



 (Movie figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play U{mjolnir.html<mjolnir.html>})



The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the C{movie15} package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable C{MOVIE15}. There is an associated variable
C{EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER} which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader)::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc


The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
C{myframes*.png}. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the C{MOVIE:} command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



Copying Computer Code from Source Files
---------------------------------------

Another type of special lines starts with C{@@@CODE} and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" below.


Inline Tagging
--------------


Doconce supports tags for I{emphasized phrases}, B{boldface phrases},
and C{verbatim text} (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as M{v = sin(x)}.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in::


        *emphasized words*


Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk::


        _several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

The line above gets typeset as
B{several words in boldface} followed by I{ephasized text}.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks::


        `call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
        while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

The typesetting result looks like this:
C{call myroutine(a, b)} looks like a Fortran call
while C{void myfunc(double *a, double *b)} must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and C{ptex2tex}) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as::


        some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"

which appears as some URL like U{Search Google<http://google.com>}.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in C{.txt}, C{.html}, C{.pdf}, C{.py}, C{.f},
C{.f77}, C{.f90}, C{.f95}, C{.sh}, C{.csh}, C{.ksh}, C{.zsh},
C{.c}, C{.cpp}, C{.cxx}, C{.pl}, and C{.java} follows the same
setup::


        see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".

which appears as see the U{Doconce Manual<manual.do.txt>}.
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:

  - In the C{html} format the links work well if the files are
    supplied with the C{.html} with the same relative location.
  - In the C{latex} and C{pdflatex} formats, such links in PDF files
    will unless the C{.tex} file has a full URL specified through
    a C{\hyperbaseurl} command and the linked files are located correctly
    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.
  - In the C{sphinx} format, local files to which there are links should only be
    located in a C{_static} or C{_static-name} subdirectory.

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a C{_static} or C{_static-name} directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (C{name} is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the C{html} format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
C{pygmentize}, e.g.::


        Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
                  -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh

Then you can link to C{_static/make.sh.html} instead of
C{subdir/make.sh}. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as C{src/myprog.py} in her
software and the document links to C{_static/myprog.py}::


        See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").


Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
I{the filename as link text}. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes::


        URL: "manual.html"

resulting in the link U{manual.html<manual.html>}.


Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes::


        Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

resulting in Click on this link: U{http://code.google.com/p/doconce<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>}.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text::


        [name: comment]

where C{name} is the name of the author of the command, and C{comment} is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless C{doconce format}
is run with a command-line argument C{--skip_inline_comments}
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the C{.do.txt} file
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats").

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII::


        Here is an example on a linear system
        ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
        where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
        $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (C{latex}, C{pdflatex}, C{html},
C{sphinx}, C{mwiki}), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system M{Ax=b}, where M{A}
is an M{nxn} matrix, and M{x} and M{b}
are vectors of length M{n}."

Comments
--------

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as I{inline comments} in Doconce and described
in the section "Inline Tagging".

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash C{#}::


        #
        # Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
        # These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
        #

Such comment lines may have some side effects in the C{rst} and C{sphinx}
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out I{before}
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash C{##} and lines enclosed by
the C{<%doc>} (beginning) and C{<%doc/>} (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.


Cross-Referencing
-----------------

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple::


        label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
        For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
C{rst} and C{sphinx} formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by C{doconce format}. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure ref{fig:viz}
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections "LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text" and "Macros (Newcommands)" are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section "Inline Tagging".

Index and Bibliography
----------------------

An index can be created for the C{latex}, C{rst}, and C{sphinx} formats
by the C{idx} keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax::


        idx{some index entry}
        idx{main entry!subentry}
        idx{`verbatim_text` and more}

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to::


        \index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: C{idx}
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style::


        as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding C{cite} command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like::


        as found in [3][14]

if C{Larsen_1986} has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and C{Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999} is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword C{BIBFILE:},
followed by a BibTeX file with extension C{.bib},
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension C{.rst},
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension C{.py}.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.::


        {
        'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
        K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
        URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
        """,
        'Larsen_1986':
        """
        O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
        *Personal Press*. 1986.
        """
        }


In the C{latex} and C{pdflatex} formats, the C{.bib} file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the C{rst} and C{sphinx} formats, the
C{.rst} file will be copied into the document at the place where the
C{BIBFILE:} keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the C{BIBFILE:} line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is C{myfile.bib}.
Insert C{BIBFILE: myfile.bib} at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the C{.rst} file, either by manual editing
of C{myfile.bbl} or using C{doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl} to automate (most of)
this editing. From the C{myfile.rst} file it is easy to create C{myfile.py}
with the dictionary version of the references.


Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the U{bibliograph.parsing<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/>} tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [1], a paper [2],
and both of them simultaneously [1] [2].

[somereader: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) ]


Tables
------

A table like

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters C{c}, C{r}, or C{l} to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes C{|} can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (C{rst} and C{sphinx} are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



Exercises, Problems, or Projects
--------------------------------

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
I{exercise}, I{problem}, or I{project}.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 C{=} characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this::


        ===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{proj:moondist}
        file=earth2moon.pdf
        solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt
        
        Here goes the running text of the project....
        

Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project I{title},
the I{label}, the I{result file}, the I{solution} (if any of
these three entities is present), and the I{running text}. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with C{!bsubex} and ending
with C{!esubex}, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) I{answer}, and I{hints}. The environments have begin-end
directives C{!bans}, C{!eans}, C{!bsol}, C{!esol}, C{!bhint}, C{!ehint}, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
C{!bc} and C{!ec}).

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the C{solution=...} directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        file=earth2moon.pdf
        
        Here goes the running text of the project....
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        !esubex


The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file C{.mydoc.exerinfo},
if C{mydoc.do.txt} is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The I{title} is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem ref{...}"
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".


Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code
--------------------------------

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" C{!bc} keyword and an "end code" C{!ec} keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and I{start at the beginning of the
line}.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the C{!bc} tag to specify a
certain environment (for C{ptex2tex} or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, C{!bc dat} corresponds to
the data file environment and C{!bc cod} is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for C{ptex2tex} this means the C{ccq} environment,
which is defined in the config file C{.ptex2tex.cfg},
while for Sphinx it defaults to the C{python} environment).

Since the config file for C{ptex2tex} can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after C{!bc} is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

Here, three arguments are defined: C{pycod} for Python code,
C{cod} also for Python code, C{cppcod} for C++ code, and C{sys}
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in C{.ptex2tex.cfg} for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, C{pro} is used for complete programs in Python, C{cod} is
for a code snippet in Python, while C{xcod} and C{xpro} implies computer
language specific typesetting where C{x} can be C{f} for Fortran, C{c}
for C, C{cpp} for C++, C{sh} for Unix shells, C{pl} for Perl, C{m} for
Matlab, C{cy} for Cython, and C{py} for Python.  The argument C{sys}
means by default C{console} for Sphinx and C{CodeTerminal} (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are C{dat} for a data file
or print out, and C{ipy} for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in C{sphinx} output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after C{!bc} can be redefined in the
C{.ptex2tex.cfg} configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
C{sphinx code-blocks} comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.


The enclosing C{!ec} tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (C{pycod} style)::


        # regular expressions for inline tags:
        inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
        inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
        INLINE_TAGS = {
            'emphasize':
            r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'verbatim':
            r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'bold':
            r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
        }

And here is a C++ code snippet (C{cppcod} style)::


        void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
            for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
                myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
            }
        }


Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then::


         @@@CODE myfile.f
         @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

The first line implies that all lines in the file C{myfile.f} are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a C{!bc Xpro} environment, where
C{X} is the extension of the filename, here C{f} (i.e., the environment
becomes C{!bc fpro} and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a C{fromto:} directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, C{X} is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the C{pro} and C{cod} arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain C{!bc} environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
C{@} sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching C{subroutine test}
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching C{C END1} (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above)::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the C{fromto:}
directive above::


              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return


Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing C{fromto:} by
C{from-to} ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text::


        # --- Start Example 1 ---
        c = -1
        A = 2
        p0 = 4
        simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
        # --- End Example 1 ---
        
        # --- Start Example 2 ---
        c = -1
        A = 1
        p0 = 0
        simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
        # --- End Example 2 ---

is easy with::


        from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2

With only C{fromto:} this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with C{ptex2tex}: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in C{ptex2tex}. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
C{.p.tex} file to be treated by C{ptex2tex}. However, the C{@@@CODE} line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the C{ptex2tex} configuration
file.)


LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text
---------------------------------

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is C{!bt} (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
C{!et}. It is important that C{!bt} and C{!et} appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


Here is the result of the above C{!bt} - C{!et} block::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
C{latex} and C{pdflatex} has of course full support. The C{html} format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although C{sphinx}, like C{html}, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
(C{pandoc} format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the C{latex} format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After C{#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")} one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
C{#else} one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.


Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.

 1. Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.
 2. Go to the Sphinx directory and load the C{conf.py} file into
    a browser.
 3. Search for "math" and comment out the
    C{'sphinx.ext.mathjax'} (enabled by default) and
    C{'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'} (disabled by default)
    lines, and uncomment the C{'sphinx.ext.pngmath'} package.
    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures
    of the mathematics.
 4. Uncomment the line with C{pngmath_dvipng_args =} and
    set the PNG resolution to C{-D 200} when the purpose is to
    generate mathematics pictures for slides.
 5. Run C{make html}.
 6. Look at the HTML source file in the C{_build/html}
    directory: all mathematics are in C{img} tags with C{src=}
    pointing to a PNG file and C{alt=} pointing to the LaTeX
    source for the formula in question. This makes it very
    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular
    mathematical expression.

Macros (Newcommands)
--------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style I{newcommand}
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
C{newcommand_replace.tex} are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names C{newcommands.tex} and
C{newcommands_keep.tex} are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
C{!bt} and C{!et} in C{newcommands_keep.tex} to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
C{newcommands_replace.tex} and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the C{newcommands*.tex} files I{must} appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

I{Example.} Suppose we have the following commands in
C{newcommand_replace.tex}::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



and these in C{newcommands_keep.tex}::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



The LaTeX block::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


will then be rendered to::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


in the current format.

Preprocessing Steps
-------------------

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(U{http://code.google.com/p/preprocess<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>}) and mako
(U{http://www.makotemplates.org/<http://www.makotemplates.org/>}). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of C{name=value} command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable C{FORMAT}
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (C{html}, C{latex},
C{plain}, C{rst}, C{sphinx}, C{epydoc}, C{st}).  It is then easy to test on
the value of C{FORMAT} and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example::


        # If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
        # PostScript files are used.
        
        # #if FORMAT == "latex"
        # Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
        \begin{figure}
        label{fig:wavepackets}
          \begin{center}
        #  #ifdef PNGFIGS
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
        #  #else
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
        #  #endif
        
        #  #ifdef PNGFIGS
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
        #  #else
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
        #  #endif
          \end{center}
          \caption{
          Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
          }
        \end{figure}
        
        # #else
        
        # Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats
        
        FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.
        
        FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.
        
        # #endif


Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section "From Doconce to Other Formats".

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces
---------------------------------------

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form C{#include "file.do.txt"}.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate C{.rst} files and an index file listing the various C{.rst}
that build up the document. To generate the various C{.rst} files one
should not run Doconce on the individual C{.do.txt} files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script C{doconce split_rst}
to split the long, complete C{.rst} into pieces. This process requires
that each C{#include "file.do.txt} line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax C{#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>}, where
C{file} is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword C{part:}.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is C{master.do.txt}.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run::


        doconce format sphinx master
        # Split master.rst into parts
        # as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
        files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`
        
        dir=sphinxm-rootdir
        
        if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
          doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
                  version=1.0 theme=default $files
          sh automake_sphinx.sh
        else
          for file in $files; do
            cp $file.rst $dir
          done
          cd $dir
          make html
          cd ..
        fi

The autogenerated C{automake_sphinx.sh} file (by C{doconce sphinx_dir})
is compatible with a master C{.rst} file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to C{doconce sphinx_dir}.
This set is the output of C{doconce split_rst}, which we catch in a
variable C{files} above.


Missing Features
----------------

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line::


        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        # insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
        # #else
        # insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
        # #endif


Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say::


        # table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce C{doconce format latex mydoc} to produce C{mydoc.p.tex}. Then
we use the C{doconce replace} and C{doconce subst} commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter::


        Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
                  '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

The C{doconce replace from_text to_text filename} command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the C{replace} method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with C{\tableofcontents}, we should use C{doconce subst},
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


Note the double backshlash in front of the C{t} character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The C{doconce subst} is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

Header and Footer
-----------------

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if C{TITLE:} or
C{#TITLE:} is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


Emacs Doconce Formatter
-----------------------

The file C{misc/.doconce-mode.el} in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

I{Step 1.} Download the Doconce tarball from C{code.google.com/p/doconce},
pack it out and go to the root directory.

I{Step 2.} Copy the C{doconce-mode.el} file to the home directory::


        cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME


I{Step 3.} Add these lines to C{$HOME/.emacs}::


        (load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
        (setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))

Emacs will now recognize files with extension C{.do.txt} and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.


Troubleshooting
===============

Disclaimer
----------

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running C{doconce format}, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


General Problems
----------------

Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce automatically removes the file C{__tmp.do.txt}, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when C{mako} and/or
C{preprocess} is run). Add the C{--debug} flag at the end of the
C{doconce} command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
C{__tmp.do.txt} is deleted.

Figure captions are incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as I{one line}, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

Preprocessor directives do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

Problems with boldface and emphasize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

Links to local directories do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links of the type::


        see the "examples directory": "src/examples"

do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file::


        see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"


Links are not typeset correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim::


        see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".

However, the following will not be typeset correctly::


        see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"

The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.


Inline verbatim code is not detected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

Strange non-English characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the encoding of the C{.do.txt} file with the Unix C{file} command
or with::


        Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands::


        Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
        
        Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile


Wrong Norwegian charcters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run C{doconce change_encoding} to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

Too short underlining of reST headlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.


Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first C{!bt} (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

Problems with code or Tex Blocks
--------------------------------

Code or math block errors in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a C{!bc}, which should have been removed when
running C{doconce format sphinx}, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then C{!bc} will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If C{idx} commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

Something is wrong with a verbatim code block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before C{!bt} and C{!bc} environments.

Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" above.  Start the
C{!bc} and C{!ec} tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the C{!bt} and C{!et} tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


Problems with reST/Sphinx Output
--------------------------------

Lists do not appear in .rst files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

Warning about duplicate link names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

Inconsistent headings in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The C{rst2*.py} and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for C{===},
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The C{!bc ipy} directive behaves this way for C{sphinx} output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to C{!bc cod} or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

Problems with LaTeX Output
--------------------------

Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the C{-shell-escape} command-line argument when
running C{latex} or C{pdflatex}::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex

Using C{doconce ptex2tex} will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using C{ptex2tex} requires the
preprocessor option C{-DMINTED} to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, C{latex} or C{pdflatex} runs the
C{pygmentize} program and the C{shell-escape} option is required.

How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via C{doconce replace}. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code::


        <%
        theorem_counter = 4
        %>
        
        # begin theorem
        label{theorem:fundamental1}
        <%
        theorem_counter += 1
        theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
        %>
        
        __Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        # end theorem
        
        # begin proof
        __Proof.__
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$|$END$
        # end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
        achievement.

The C{.p.tex} output file now reads::


        % begin theorem
        label{theorem:fundamental1}
        
        
        \paragraph{Theorem 5.}
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        % end theorem
        
        % begin proof
        \paragraph{Proof.}
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$
        % end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
        achievement.

Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the C{% begin ...} and C{% end ...} lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the C{.p.tex} file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with I{Theorem}.
The following Bash script does the job::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
C{mydoc.p.tex} file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting C{mydoc.tex} file now becomes::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the C{ptex2tex} program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).


The LaTeX file does not compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving::


        \code{...}

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

Inline verbatim gives error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.::


        some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
        ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
        then replace this by
        {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
        which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
        capture the second }

The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.



Errors in figure captions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper C{texttt} command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

Chapters are ignored
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run C{ptex2tex} with the option C{-DBOOK} to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:

1. Make a little Bash script that performs a series of
   C{doconce subst} (regular expressions) or C{doconce replace} (regular text)
   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to
   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).
2. Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate
   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then
   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This
   means that the C{doconce format latex} command does not generate
   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these
   files.
   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro
   text and include the various text pieces in this file.
   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files
   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the
   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but
   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.

Problems with gwiki Output
--------------------------

Strange nested lists in gwiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the C{.gwiki} file directly.

Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

Problems with HTML Output
-------------------------

How can I change the layout of the HTML page?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out C{TITLE:} to get HTML without a header and footer). The
C{--html-template=filename} command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title (C{%(title)s}),
a date (C{%(date)s}), and the main body of text (C{%(main)s}).
For typesetting code, C{pygments} is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by C{--no-pygments-html} (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the C{sphinx} format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via C{doconce replace} and
C{doconce subst} in the script that generates the final documents).

Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script::


        doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
         '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
        doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
         '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html



Debugging
---------

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
C{_doconce_debugging.log}, if the to C{doconce format} after the filename
is C{debug}. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



Basic Parsing Ideas
===================


The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression::


        (?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?


That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and I{placed at the end of
the doc string}. Note that C{argument}, C{keyword argument}, C{return},
C{instance variable}, C{class variable}, and C{module variable} are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted::


            - argument x: x value (float),
              which must be a positive number.
            - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
              the iterations.
            - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
            - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
            - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
            - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
              (bool variable).


The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    @var x: 
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    @var tolerance: 
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

What Is Doconce?
================


Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via rst2* programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via unoconv) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies
============================================

Doconce
-------

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at http://code.google.com/p/doconce.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (hg) source follows the standard procedure::


        # Doconce
        hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version::


        cd doconce
        hg pull
        hg update
        sudo python setup.py install


Debian GNU/Linux users can also run::


        sudo apt-get install doconce

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run::


        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install doconce


Dependencies
------------

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the Preprocess (http://code.google.com/p/preprocess)
preprocessor, this program must be installed::


        svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
        cd preprocess
        cd doconce
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
Mako (http://www.makotemplates.org). Its installation is most
conveniently done by pip::


        pip install Mako

This command requires pip to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by::


        sudo apt-get install python-pip

Alternatively, one can install from the pip source code (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need ptex2tex (http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex),
which is installed by::


        svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
        cd ptex2tex
        sudo python setup.py install

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, cp2texmf.sh::


        cd latex
        sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
        cd ../..

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that ptex2tex potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by::


        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the ~/texmf/tex/latex/misc directory).

Note that the doconce ptex2tex command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the ptex2tex
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by ptex2tex and doconce ptext2tex
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package Pygments (http://pygments.org)
to be installed::


        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
        cd pygments
        sudo python setup.py install


If you use the minted style together with ptex2tex, you have to
enable it by the -DMINTED command-line argument to ptex2tex.  All
use of the minted style requires the -shell-escape command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., latex -shell-escape or pdflatex
-shell-escape.


reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rst output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the docutils (http://docutils.sourceforge.net) package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by::


        svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
        cd docutils
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install::


        sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths


There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
rst2pdf (http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf). Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the rst2pdf directory and
run the usual sudo python setup.py install.


Output to sphinx requires of course Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org),
installed by::


        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
        cd sphinx
        sudo python setup.py install
        cd ..


Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce format pandoc outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the pandoc program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of Pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), written in Haskell, is most
easily done by::


        sudo apt-get install pandoc


Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is epydoc one needs that program too, installed
by::


        svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
        cd epydoc
        sudo make install
        cd ..


*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
apt-get install command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For svn directories, go to the directory,
run svn update, and then sudo python setup.py install. For
Mercurial (hg) directories, go to the directory, run
hg pull; hg update, and then sudo python setup.py install.




Demos
-----


The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the::


        docs/manual/manual.do.txt

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
demo web page (https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html)
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file make.sh in the same directory as the manual.do.txt file
(the current text) shows how to run doconce format on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

In the tutorial directory there is also a make.sh file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
web demo (https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html)
of the results.



From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document mydoc.do.txt to various other
formats applies the script doconce format::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The mako or preprocess programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to mako or preprocess can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable FORMAT is always defined as the current format when
running preprocess. That is, in the last example, FORMAT is
defined as latex. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like #if FORMAT == "latex".

The command-line arguments --no-preprocess and --no-mako turn off
running preprocess and mako, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file mydoc.do.txt
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file mydoc.html can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the pygmentize program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument --no-pygments-html
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain <pre> HTML tags. The option --pygments-html-linenos turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": %(title)s for a title,
%(date)s for a date, and %(main)s for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
DATE: line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert %(title)s and
%(date)s at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by %(main)s. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html


Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc

The name of the output file is mydoc.mkd.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats::


        Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd

Pandoc supports latex, html, odt (OpenOffice), docx (Microsoft
Word), rtf, texinfo, to mention some. The -R option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the --toc option generates a table of contents.
See the Pandoc documentation (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html)
for the many features of the pandoc program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
doconce format pandoc and then translating using pandoc, or
doconce format latex, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using pandoc.
Here is an example on the latter strategy::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex

When we go through pandoc, only single equations or align*
environments are well understood.

Quite some doconce replace and doconce subst edits might be needed
on the .mkd or .tex files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax::


        Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
        Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd

The -s option adds a proper header and footer to the mydoc.html file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file mydoc.tex from mydoc.do.txt is done in two steps:

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form mydoc.p.tex for
the ptex2tex program (or doconce ptex2tex)::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files newcommands.tex, newcommands_keep.tex, or
newcommands_replace.tex (see the section "Macros (Newcommands)").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ptex2tex (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

In case you do not have ptex2tex, you may run a (very) simplified version::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc


Note that Doconce generates a .p.tex file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 * BOOK for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)

 * PALATINO for the Palatino font

 * HELVETIA for the Helvetica font

 * A4PAPER for A4 paper size

 * A6PAPER for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)

 * MOVIE15 for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies

 * PREAMBLE to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)

 * MINTED for inclusion of the minted package (which requires latex
   or pdflatex to be run with the -shell-escape option)

The ptex2tex tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any !bc command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your .ptex2tex.cfg
file, e.g., !bc sys for a terminal session, where sys is set to
a certain environment in .ptex2tex.cfg (e.g., CodeTerminal).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the doconce ptex2tex command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the .p.tex file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example::


        Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
                  -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
                  "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
                  fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt

Note that @ must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as minted
above, which implies \begin{minted}{fortran} and \end{minted} as
begin and end for blocks inside !bc fpro and !ec).  Specifying
envir=ans:nt means that all other environments are typeset with the
anslistings.sty package, e.g., !bc cppcod will then result in
\begin{c++}. If no environments like sys, fpro, or the common
envir are defined on the command line, the plain \begin{verbatim}
and \end{verbatim} used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the mydoc.tex file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute section by section* to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the doconce replace and doconce subst
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples::


        Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
        Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
                  'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile mydoc.tex
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc


If one wishes to run ptex2tex and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (Minted_Python, Minted_Cpp, etc., in
ptex2tex specified through the *pro and *cod variables in
.ptex2tex.cfg or $HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running ptex2tex with the
-DMINTED option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, latex must be run with the
-shell-escape option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

When running doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted (or other minted
specifications with doconce ptex2tex), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the -DMINTED option.


PDFLaTeX
--------

Running pdflatex instead of latex follows almost the same steps,
but the start is::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

Then ptex2tex is run as explained above, and finally::


        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file mydoc.rst::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice


The OpenOffice file mydoc.odt can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program unovonv
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run::


        Terminal> unoconv --show

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
mydoc.odt to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF::


        Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
        Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt


*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by latex as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the sphinx output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the doconce sphinx_dir command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords author, title, and version are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, version is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files file1,
file2, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files file1, file2, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of dirname is sphinx-rootdir. The theme
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is 'default').

With a single-file document in mydoc.do.txt one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory sphinx-rootdir is made with
relevant files.

The doconce sphinx_dir command generates a script
automake_sphinx.py for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run automake_sphinx.py or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The doconce sphinx_dir script copies directories named figs or
figures over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, automake_sphinx.py must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not http: or file: URLs), must be
placed in the _static subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility doconce sphinxfix_localURLs is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say dir1/dir2/myfile.txt it
replaces the link by _static/myfile.txt and copies
dir1/dir2/myfile.txt to a local _static directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in _static or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all _static/* files to the
_static subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a _static or _static-name directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the conf.py
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
make-themes.sh can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes fenics and pyramid, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are _build/html_fenics
and _build/html_pyramid, respectively. Without arguments,
make-themes.sh makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file mydoc.do.txt.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive sphinx-quickstart
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF

The autogenerated conf.py file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The doconce sphinx_dir generator makes an extended conv.py
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the mydoc.rst file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with mydoc.rst in the sphinx-rootdir
directory. Either edit mydoc.rst so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to sphinx-rootdir.
Links to local files in mydoc.rst must be modified to links to
files in the _static directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated index.rst file so that mydoc.rst
is included, i.e., add mydoc to the toctree section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before mydoc are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with index.html files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows !bc: cod gives Python
(code-block:: python in Sphinx syntax) and cppcod gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
Googlecode wiki (http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax), MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
gwiki, mwiki, and cwiki, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
        Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt


The Googlecode wiki document, mydoc.gwiki, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the .gwiki file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of mwlib (http://pediapress.com/code/). This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write Wikibooks (http://en.wikibooks.org)
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
.rst file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if .eps or .png is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The make.sh files in docs/manual and docs/tutorial
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



The Doconce Markup Language
===========================

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

Lists
-----

An unordered bullet list makes use of the * as bullet sign
and is indented as follows::


           * item 1
        
           * item 2
        
             * subitem 1, if there are more
               lines, each line must
               be intended as shown here
        
             * subitem 2,
               also spans two lines
        
           * item 3


This list gets typeset as

   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines


   * item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an o (as the first letter
in "ordered")::


           o item 1
        
           o item 2
        
             * subitem 1
        
             * subitem 2
        
           o item 3


resulting in

  1. item 1

  2. item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2


  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon::


           - keyword1: explanation of keyword1
        
           - keyword2: explanation
             of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
             if there are multiple
             lines)


The result becomes

   keyword1: 
     explanation of keyword1

   keyword2: 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)

Special Lines
-------------

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with TITLE:, AUTHOR:, and DATE: are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax::


        name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3

The at with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the and with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax::


        name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2

Multiple authors require multiple AUTHOR: lines. All information
associated with TITLE: and AUTHOR: keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language

Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including rst and sphinx)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format::


        Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
        Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
        A. Dummy Author
        
        [1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
        [2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
        [3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as today.


*Table of Contents.* A table of contents can be generated by the line::


        TOC: on

This line is usually placed after the DATE: line.
A value off turns off the table of contents.


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   * 9 = characters for chapters

   * 7 for sections

   * 5 for subsections

   * 3 for subsubsections

   * 2 *underscrores* (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
*must* be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples::


        __Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
        various section headings.
        
        ========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========
        
        Some text.
        
        
        ======= Example on a Section Heading =======
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        
        ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        __A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.


Special Lines
=============

Figures
-------


Figures are recognized by the special line syntax::


        FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption
        

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say .eps when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's convert utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for TITLE: and AUTHOR: lines, all information
related to a figure line *must be written on the same line*. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as FIGURE: will be
included in the formatted caption).

FIGURE:[figs/streamtubes, width=400] Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. {fig:viz}

Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
montage program from the ImageMagick suite::


        montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
                file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png

The option -tile XxY gives X figures in the horizontal direction and
Y in the vertical direction (tile 2x means two figures per row
and -tile x2 means two rows).

Movies
------

Here is an example on the MOVIE: keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the latex, html, rst, and sphinx formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie::


        MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption
        



 (Movie figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play mjolnir.html)



The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the movie15 package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable MOVIE15. There is an associated variable
EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader)::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc


The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
myframes*.png. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the MOVIE: command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



Copying Computer Code from Source Files
---------------------------------------

Another type of special lines starts with @@@CODE and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" below.


Inline Tagging
--------------


Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, _boldface phrases_,
and verbatim text (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x).

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in::


        *emphasized words*


Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk::


        _several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

The line above gets typeset as
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks::


        `call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
        while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

The typesetting result looks like this:
call myroutine(a, b) looks like a Fortran call
while void myfunc(double *a, double *b) must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and ptex2tex) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as::


        some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"

which appears as some URL like Search Google (http://google.com).
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in .txt, .html, .pdf, .py, .f,
.f77, .f90, .f95, .sh, .csh, .ksh, .zsh,
.c, .cpp, .cxx, .pl, and .java follows the same
setup::


        see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".

which appears as see the Doconce Manual (manual.do.txt).
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:

  * In the html format the links work well if the files are
    supplied with the .html with the same relative location.

  * In the latex and pdflatex formats, such links in PDF files
    will unless the .tex file has a full URL specified through
    a \hyperbaseurl command and the linked files are located correctly
    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.

  * In the sphinx format, local files to which there are links should only be
    located in a _static or _static-name subdirectory.

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a _static or _static-name directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (name is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the html format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
pygmentize, e.g.::


        Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
                  -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh

Then you can link to _static/make.sh.html instead of
subdir/make.sh. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as src/myprog.py in her
software and the document links to _static/myprog.py::


        See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").


Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
*the filename as link text*. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes::


        URL: "manual.html"

resulting in the link manual.html.


Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes::


        Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

resulting in Click on this link: http://code.google.com/p/doconce.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text::


        [name: comment]

where name is the name of the author of the command, and comment is a
plain text text. The name and comment are visible in the output unless doconce format
is run with a command-line argument --skip_inline_comments
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the .do.txt file
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats").

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII::


        Here is an example on a linear system
        ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
        where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
        $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (latex, pdflatex, html,
sphinx, mwiki), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system Ax=b, where A
is an nxn matrix, and x and b
are vectors of length n."

Comments
--------

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as *inline comments* in Doconce and described
in the section "Inline Tagging".

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash #:
!bc
        #
        # Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
        # These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
        #

Such comment lines may have some side effects in the rst and sphinx
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out *before*
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash ## and lines enclosed by
the <%doc> (beginning) and <%doc/> (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.


Cross-Referencing
-----------------

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple::


        label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
        For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
rst and sphinx formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by doconce format. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure ref{fig:viz}
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections "LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text" and "Macros (Newcommands)" are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section "Inline Tagging".

Index and Bibliography
----------------------

An index can be created for the latex, rst, and sphinx formats
by the idx keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax::


        idx{some index entry}
        idx{main entry!subentry}
        idx{`verbatim_text` and more}

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to::


        \index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: idx
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style::


        as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding cite command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like::


        as found in [3][14]

if Larsen_1986 has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999 is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword BIBFILE:,
followed by a BibTeX file with extension .bib,
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension .rst,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension .py.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.::


        {
        'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
        K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
        URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
        """,
        'Larsen_1986':
        """
        O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
        *Personal Press*. 1986.
        """
        }


In the latex and pdflatex formats, the .bib file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the rst and sphinx formats, the
.rst file will be copied into the document at the place where the
BIBFILE: keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the BIBFILE: line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is myfile.bib.
Insert BIBFILE: myfile.bib at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the .rst file, either by manual editing
of myfile.bbl or using doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl to automate (most of)
this editing. From the myfile.rst file it is easy to create myfile.py
with the dictionary version of the references.


Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the bibliograph.parsing (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/) tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [1], a paper [2],
and both of them simultaneously [1] [2].

Tables
------

A table like

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters c, r, or l to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes | can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (rst and sphinx are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



Exercises, Problems, or Projects
--------------------------------

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
*exercise*, *problem*, or *project*.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 = characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this::


        ===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{proj:moondist}
        file=earth2moon.pdf
        solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt
        
        Here goes the running text of the project....
        

Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project *title*,
the *label*, the *result file*, the *solution* (if any of
these three entities is present), and the *running text*. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with !bsubex and ending
with !esubex, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) *answer*, and *hints*. The environments have begin-end
directives !bans, !eans, !bsol, !esol, !bhint, !ehint, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
  !bc and !ec).

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the solution=... directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        file=earth2moon.pdf
        
        Here goes the running text of the project....
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        !esubex


The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file .mydoc.exerinfo,
if mydoc.do.txt is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The *title* is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem ref{...}"
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".


Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code
--------------------------------

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" !bc keyword and an "end code" !ec keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the !bc tag to specify a
certain environment (for ptex2tex or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, !bc dat corresponds to
the data file environment and !bc cod is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for ptex2tex this means the ccq environment,
which is defined in the config file .ptex2tex.cfg,
while for Sphinx it defaults to the python environment).

Since the config file for ptex2tex can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after !bc is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

Here, three arguments are defined: pycod for Python code,
cod also for Python code, cppcod for C++ code, and sys
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in .ptex2tex.cfg for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, pro is used for complete programs in Python, cod is
for a code snippet in Python, while xcod and xpro implies computer
language specific typesetting where x can be f for Fortran, c
for C, cpp for C++, sh for Unix shells, pl for Perl, m for
Matlab, cy for Cython, and py for Python.  The argument sys
means by default console for Sphinx and CodeTerminal (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are dat for a data file
or print out, and ipy for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in sphinx output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after !bc can be redefined in the
.ptex2tex.cfg configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
sphinx code-blocks comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.


The enclosing !ec tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (pycod style)::


        # regular expressions for inline tags:
        inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
        inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
        INLINE_TAGS = {
            'emphasize':
            r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'verbatim':
            r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'bold':
            r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
        }

And here is a C++ code snippet (cppcod style)::


        void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
            for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
                myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
            }
        }


Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then::


         @@@CODE myfile.f
         @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

The first line implies that all lines in the file myfile.f are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a !bc Xpro environment, where
X is the extension of the filename, here f (i.e., the environment
becomes !bc fpro and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a fromto: directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, X is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the pro and cod arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain !bc environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
@ sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching subroutine test
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching C END1 (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above)::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the fromto:
directive above::


              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return


Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing fromto: by
from-to ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text::


        # --- Start Example 1 ---
        c = -1
        A = 2
        p0 = 4
        simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
        # --- End Example 1 ---
        
        # --- Start Example 2 ---
        c = -1
        A = 1
        p0 = 0
        simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
        # --- End Example 2 ---

is easy with::


        from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2

With only fromto: this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with ptex2tex: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in ptex2tex. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
.p.tex file to be treated by ptex2tex. However, the @@@CODE line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the ptex2tex configuration
file.)


LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text
---------------------------------

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is !bt (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
  !et. It is important that !bt and !et appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline::


        !bt
        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}
        


Here is the result of the above !bt - !et block::

        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}


The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
latex and pdflatex has of course full support. The html format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although sphinx, like html, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
(pandoc format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the latex format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc") one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
#else one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.


Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.

 1. Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.

 2. Go to the Sphinx directory and load the conf.py file into
    a browser.

 3. Search for "math" and comment out the
    'sphinx.ext.mathjax' (enabled by default) and
    'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl' (disabled by default)
    lines, and uncomment the 'sphinx.ext.pngmath' package.
    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures
    of the mathematics.

 4. Uncomment the line with pngmath_dvipng_args = and
    set the PNG resolution to -D 200 when the purpose is to
    generate mathematics pictures for slides.

 5. Run make html.

 6. Look at the HTML source file in the _build/html
    directory: all mathematics are in img tags with src=
    pointing to a PNG file and alt= pointing to the LaTeX
    source for the formula in question. This makes it very
    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular
    mathematical expression.

Macros (Newcommands)
--------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
newcommand_replace.tex are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names newcommands.tex and
newcommands_keep.tex are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
  !bt and !et in newcommands_keep.tex to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
newcommands_replace.tex and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the newcommands*.tex files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
newcommand_replace.tex::


        \newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
        \newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
        \newcommand{\Q}{\pmb{Q}}


and these in newcommands_keep.tex::


        \newcommand{\x}{\pmb{x}}
        \newcommand{\normalvec}{\pmb{n}}
        \newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}


The LaTeX block::


        \beqa
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   label{my:eq2}
        \eeqa

will then be rendered to::

        \begin{align}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{align}

in the current format.

Preprocessing Steps
-------------------

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(http://code.google.com/p/preprocess) and mako
(http://www.makotemplates.org/). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of name=value command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable FORMAT
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (html, latex,
plain, rst, sphinx, epydoc, st).  It is then easy to test on
the value of FORMAT and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example::


        # If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
        # PostScript files are used.
        
        # #if FORMAT == "latex"
        # Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
        \begin{figure}
        label{fig:wavepackets}
          \begin{center}
        #  #ifdef PNGFIGS
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
        #  #else
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
        #  #endif
        
        #  #ifdef PNGFIGS
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
        #  #else
        \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
        #  #endif
          \end{center}
          \caption{
          Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
          }
        \end{figure}
        
        # #else
        
        # Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats
        
        FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.
        
        FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.
        
        # #endif


Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section "From Doconce to Other Formats".

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces
---------------------------------------

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form #include "file.do.txt".
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate .rst files and an index file listing the various .rst
that build up the document. To generate the various .rst files one
should not run Doconce on the individual .do.txt files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script doconce split_rst
to split the long, complete .rst into pieces. This process requires
that each #include "file.do.txt line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax #>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>, where
file is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword part:.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is master.do.txt.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run::


        doconce format sphinx master
        # Split master.rst into parts
        # as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
        files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`
        
        dir=sphinxm-rootdir
        
        if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
          doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
                  version=1.0 theme=default $files
          sh automake_sphinx.sh
        else
          for file in $files; do
            cp $file.rst $dir
          done
          cd $dir
          make html
          cd ..
        fi

The autogenerated automake_sphinx.sh file (by doconce sphinx_dir)
is compatible with a master .rst file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to doconce sphinx_dir.
This set is the output of doconce split_rst, which we catch in a
variable files above.


Missing Features
----------------

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line::


        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        # insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
        # #else
        # insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
        # #endif


Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say::


        # table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce doconce format latex mydoc to produce mydoc.p.tex. Then
we use the doconce replace and doconce subst commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter::


        Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
                  '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

The doconce replace from_text to_text filename command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the replace method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with \tableofcontents, we should use doconce subst,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character::


        Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
                  '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

Note the double backshlash in front of the t character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The doconce subst is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

Header and Footer
-----------------

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if TITLE: or
#TITLE: is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


Emacs Doconce Formatter
-----------------------

The file misc/.doconce-mode.el in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

*Step 1.* Download the Doconce tarball from code.google.com/p/doconce,
pack it out and go to the root directory.

*Step 2.* Copy the doconce-mode.el file to the home directory::


        cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME


*Step 3.* Add these lines to $HOME/.emacs::


        (load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
        (setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))

Emacs will now recognize files with extension .do.txt and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.


Troubleshooting
===============

Disclaimer
----------

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running doconce format, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


General Problems
----------------

Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce automatically removes the file __tmp.do.txt, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when mako and/or
preprocess is run). Add the --debug flag at the end of the
doconce command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
__tmp.do.txt is deleted.

Figure captions are incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

Preprocessor directives do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

Problems with boldface and emphasize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

Links to local directories do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links of the type::


        see the "examples directory": "src/examples"

do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file::


        see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"


Links are not typeset correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim::


        see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".

However, the following will not be typeset correctly::


        see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"

The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.


Inline verbatim code is not detected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

Strange non-English characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the encoding of the .do.txt file with the Unix file command
or with::


        Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands::


        Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
        
        Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile


Wrong Norwegian charcters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run doconce change_encoding to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

Too short underlining of reST headlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.


Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first !bt (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

Problems with code or Tex Blocks
--------------------------------

Code or math block errors in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a !bc, which should have been removed when
running doconce format sphinx, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then !bc will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If idx commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

Something is wrong with a verbatim code block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before !bt and !bc environments.

Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" above.  Start the
  !bc and !ec tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the !bt and !et tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


Problems with reST/Sphinx Output
--------------------------------

Lists do not appear in .rst files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

Warning about duplicate link names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

Inconsistent headings in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rst2*.py and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for ===,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The !bc ipy directive behaves this way for sphinx output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to !bc cod or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

Problems with LaTeX Output
--------------------------

Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the -shell-escape command-line argument when
running latex or pdflatex::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
        Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex

Using doconce ptex2tex will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using ptex2tex requires the
preprocessor option -DMINTED to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, latex or pdflatex runs the
pygmentize program and the shell-escape option is required.

How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via doconce replace. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code::


        <%
        theorem_counter = 4
        %>
        
        # begin theorem
        label{theorem:fundamental1}
        <%
        theorem_counter += 1
        theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
        %>
        
        __Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        # end theorem
        
        # begin proof
        __Proof.__
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$|$END$
        # end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
        achievement.

The .p.tex output file now reads::


        % begin theorem
        label{theorem:fundamental1}
        
        
        \paragraph{Theorem 5.}
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        % end theorem
        
        % begin proof
        \paragraph{Proof.}
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$
        % end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
        achievement.

Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the % begin ... and % end ... lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the .p.tex file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with *Theorem*.
The following Bash script does the job::


        file=mydoc.p.tex
        thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
        doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
        doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
        doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
        doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file

More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
mydoc.p.tex file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting mydoc.tex file now becomes::


        \usepackage{theorem}
        \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]
        
        ...
        
        \begin{theorem}
        \label{theorem:fundamental1}
        
        
        
        Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
        \end{theorem}
        
        % begin proof
        \paragraph{Proof.}
        Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
        $\Diamond$
        % end proof
        
        As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
        achievement.

Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the ptex2tex program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).


The LaTeX file does not compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving::


        \code{...}

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

Inline verbatim gives error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.::


        some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
        ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
        then replace this by
        {\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
        which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
        capture the second }

The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.



Errors in figure captions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper texttt command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

Chapters are ignored
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run ptex2tex with the option -DBOOK to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:

1. Make a little Bash script that performs a series of
   doconce subst (regular expressions) or doconce replace (regular text)
   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to
   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).

2. Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate
   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then
   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This
   means that the doconce format latex command does not generate
   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these
   files.
   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro
   text and include the various text pieces in this file.
   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files
   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the
   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but
   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.

Problems with gwiki Output
--------------------------

Strange nested lists in gwiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the .gwiki file directly.

Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

Problems with HTML Output
-------------------------

How can I change the layout of the HTML page?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out TITLE: to get HTML without a header and footer). The
--html-template=filename command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title (%(title)s),
a date (%(date)s), and the main body of text (%(main)s).
For typesetting code, pygments is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by --no-pygments-html (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the sphinx format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via doconce replace and
doconce subst in the script that generates the final documents).

Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script::


        doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
         '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
        doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
         '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html



Debugging
---------

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
_doconce_debugging.log, if the to doconce format after the filename
is debug. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



Basic Parsing Ideas
===================


The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression::


        (?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?


That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that argument, keyword argument, return,
instance variable, class variable, and module variable are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted::


            - argument x: x value (float),
              which must be a positive number.
            - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
              the iterations.
            - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
            - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
            - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
            - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
              (bool variable).


The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    module variable x: 
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.

    module variable tolerance: 
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

What Is Doconce?
================


Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
    (reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
    formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
    emails). From reST you can (via `rst2*` programs) go to XML, HTML,
    LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via `unoconv`) to
    RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
    DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
    Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
    Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files via regular expressions
    for the start and end lines.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
    supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
    lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
    syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
    such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
    construction for generating parts of the text.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies
============================================

Doconce
-------

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at <http://code.google.com/p/doconce>.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (`hg`) source follows the standard procedure:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo apt-get install doconce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependencies
------------

Preprocessors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make use of the [Preprocess](http://code.google.com/p/preprocess)
preprocessor, this program must be installed:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
[Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org). Its installation is most
conveniently done by `pip`,


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
pip install Mako
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This command requires `pip` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo apt-get install python-pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, one can install from the `pip` [source code](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).

Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need [ptex2tex](http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex),
which is installed by


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, `cp2texmf.sh`:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This script copies some special stylefiles that
that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the `~/texmf/tex/latex/misc` directory).

Note that the `doconce ptex2tex` command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the `ptex2tex`
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by `ptex2tex` and `doconce ptext2tex`
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package [Pygments](http://pygments.org)
to be installed:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use the minted style together with `ptex2tex`, you have to
enable it by the `-DMINTED` command-line argument to `ptex2tex`.  All
use of the minted style requires the `-shell-escape` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., `latex -shell-escape` or `pdflatex
-shell-escape`.


reStructuredText (reST) Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `rst` output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the [docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net) package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
[rst2pdf](http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf). Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the `rst2pdf` directory and
run the usual `sudo python setup.py install`.


Output to `sphinx` requires of course [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org),
installed by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Markdown and Pandoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Doconce format `pandoc` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the `pandoc` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), written in Haskell, is most
easily done by


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
sudo apt-get install pandoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Epydoc Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the output format is `epydoc` one needs that program too, installed
by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Remark.* Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
`apt-get install` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For `svn` directories, go to the directory,
run `svn update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`. For
Mercurial (`hg`) directories, go to the directory, run
`hg pull; hg update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`.




Demos
-----


The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
docs/manual/manual.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
[demo web page](https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html)
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file `make.sh` in the same directory as the `manual.do.txt` file
(the current text) shows how to run `doconce format` on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the `tutorial` directory there is also a `make.sh` file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
[web demo](https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html)
of the results.



From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document `mydoc.do.txt` to various other
formats applies the script `doconce format`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

or just

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `mako` or `preprocess` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to `mako` or `preprocess` can be added after the
filename. For example,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The variable `FORMAT` is always defined as the current format when
running `preprocess`. That is, in the last example, `FORMAT` is
defined as `latex`. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like `#if FORMAT == "latex"`.

The command-line arguments `--no-preprocess` and `--no-mako` turn off
running `preprocess` and `mako`, respectively.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce
file by running:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file `mydoc.do.txt`
is performed by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The resulting file `mydoc.html` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

If the Pygments package (including the `pygmentize` program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument `--no-pygments-html`
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain `<pre>` HTML tags. The option `--pygments-html-linenos` turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.

The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three "slots": `%(title)s` for a title,
`%(date)s` for a date, and `%(main)s` for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
`DATE:` line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert `%(title)s` and
`%(date)s` at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by `%(main)s`. Here is an example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pandoc and Markdown
-------------------

Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name of the output file is `mydoc.mkd`.
From this format one can go to numerous other formats:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk --toc mydoc.mkd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pandoc supports `latex`, `html`, `odt` (OpenOffice), `docx` (Microsoft
Word), `rtf`, `texinfo`, to mention some. The `-R` option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the `--toc` option generates a table of contents.
See the [Pandoc documentation](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html)
for the many features of the `pandoc` program.

Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
`doconce format pandoc` and then translating using `pandoc`, or
`doconce format latex`, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using `pandoc`.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we go through `pandoc`, only single equations or `align*`
environments are well understood.

Quite some `doconce replace` and `doconce subst` edits might be needed
on the `.mkd` or `.tex` files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.

Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal> pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `-s` option adds a proper header and footer to the `mydoc.html` file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.


LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file `mydoc.tex` from `mydoc.do.txt` is done in two steps:

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form `mydoc.p.tex` for
the `ptex2tex` program (or `doconce ptex2tex`):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files `newcommands.tex`, `newcommands_keep.tex`, or
`newcommands_replace.tex` (see the section [Macros (Newcommands)](#s))).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run `ptex2tex` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you do not have `ptex2tex`, you may run a (very) simplified version:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that Doconce generates a `.p.tex` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through `-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional`.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
`-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage`.

Preprocessor variables to be defined or undefined are

 * `BOOK` for the "book" documentclass rather than the standard
   "article" class (necessary if you apply chapter headings)

 * `PALATINO` for the Palatino font

 * `HELVETIA` for the Helvetica font

 * `A4PAPER` for A4 paper size

 * `A6PAPER` for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small devices)

 * `MOVIE15` for using the movie15 LaTeX package to display movies

 * `PREAMBLE` to turn the LaTeX preamble on or off (i.e., complete document
   or document to be included elsewhere)

 * `MINTED` for inclusion of the minted package (which requires `latex`
   or `pdflatex` to be run with the `-shell-escape` option)

The `ptex2tex` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any `!bc` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your `.ptex2tex.cfg`
file, e.g., `!bc sys` for a terminal session, where `sys` is set to
a certain environment in `.ptex2tex.cfg` (e.g., `CodeTerminal`).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.

Also the `doconce ptex2tex` command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the `.p.tex` file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          "sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}" \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that `@` must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as `minted`
above, which implies `\begin{minted}{fortran}` and `\end{minted}` as
begin and end for blocks inside `!bc fpro` and `!ec`).  Specifying
`envir=ans:nt` means that all other environments are typeset with the
`anslistings.sty` package, e.g., `!bc cppcod` will then result in
`\begin{c++}`. If no environments like `sys`, `fpro`, or the common
`envir` are defined on the command line, the plain `\begin{verbatim}`
and `\end{verbatim}` used.


*Step 2b (optional).* Edit the `mydoc.tex` file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute `section` by `section*` to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst`
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal> doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g<1> \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g<2>' mydoc.tex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.

*Step 3.* Compile `mydoc.tex`
and create the PDF file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If one wishes to run `ptex2tex` and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (`Minted_Python`, `Minted_Cpp`, etc., in
`ptex2tex` specified through the `*pro` and `*cod` variables in
`.ptex2tex.cfg` or `$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg`), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running `ptex2tex` with the
`-DMINTED` option:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case, `latex` must be run with the
`-shell-escape` option:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running `doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted` (or other minted
specifications with `doconce ptex2tex`), the minted package is automatically
included so there is no need for the `-DMINTED` option.


PDFLaTeX
--------

Running `pdflatex` instead of `latex` follows almost the same steps,
but the start is

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then `ptex2tex` is run as explained above, and finally

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file `mydoc.rst`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may now produce various other formats:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenOffice file `mydoc.odt` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
However, it is more convenient to use the program `unovonv`
to convert between the many formats OpenOffice supports *on the command line*.
Run

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> unoconv --show
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to see all the formats that are supported.
For example, the following commands take
`mydoc.odt` to Microsoft Office Open XML format,
classic MS Word format, and PDF:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> unoconv -f ooxml mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f doc mydoc.odt
Terminal> unoconv -f pdf mydoc.odt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Remark about Mathematical Typesetting.* At the time of this writing, there is no easy way to go from Doconce
and LaTeX mathematics to reST and further to OpenOffice and the
"MS Word world". Mathematics is only fully supported by `latex` as
output and to a wide extent also supported by the `sphinx` output format.
Some links for going from LaTeX to Word are listed below.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the `doconce sphinx_dir` command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The keywords `author`, `title`, and `version` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, `version` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files `file1`,
`file2`, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files `file1`, `file2`, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of `dirname` is `sphinx-rootdir`. The `theme`
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is `'default'`).

With a single-file document in `mydoc.do.txt` one often just runs

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory `sphinx-rootdir` is made with
relevant files.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` command generates a script
`automake_sphinx.py` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run `automake_sphinx.py` or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` script copies directories named `figs` or
`figures` over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, `automake_sphinx.py` must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not `http:` or `file:` URLs), must be
placed in the `_static` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility `doconce sphinxfix_localURLs` is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say `dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` it
replaces the link by `_static/myfile.txt` and copies
`dir1/dir2/myfile.txt` to a local `_static` directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in `_static` or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all `_static/*` files to the
`_static` subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a `_static` or `_static-name` directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the `conf.py`
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
`make-themes.sh` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes `fenics` and `pyramid`, one writes

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The resulting directories with HTML documents are `_build/html_fenics`
and `_build/html_pyramid`, respectively. Without arguments,
`make-themes.sh` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file `mydoc.do.txt`.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive `sphinx-quickstart`
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The autogenerated `conf.py` file
may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The `doconce sphinx_dir` generator makes an extended `conv.py`
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.


*Step 3.* Copy the `mydoc.rst` file to the Sphinx root directory:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with `mydoc.rst` in the `sphinx-rootdir`
directory. Either edit `mydoc.rst` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to `sphinx-rootdir`.
Links to local files in `mydoc.rst` must be modified to links to
files in the `_static` directory, see comment above.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated `index.rst` file so that `mydoc.rst`
is included, i.e., add `mydoc` to the `toctree` section so that it becomes

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(The spaces before `mydoc` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with `index.html` files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.

*Step 6.* View the result:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows `!bc`: `cod` gives Python
(`code-block:: python` in Sphinx syntax) and `cppcod` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Wiki Formats
------------

There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
[Googlecode wiki](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax), MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
`gwiki`, `mwiki`, and `cwiki`, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal> doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Googlecode wiki document, `mydoc.gwiki`, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the `.gwiki` file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).

From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of [mwlib](http://pediapress.com/code/). This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write [Wikibooks](http://en.wikibooks.org)
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
`.rst` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if `.eps` or `.png` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The `make.sh` files in `docs/manual` and `docs/tutorial`
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



The Doconce Markup Language
===========================

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

Lists
-----

An unordered bullet list makes use of the `*` as bullet sign
and is indented as follows


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This list gets typeset as

   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines


   * item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an `o` (as the first letter
in "ordered"):


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

resulting in

  1. item 1

  2. item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2


  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The result becomes

   keyword1:
  :    
     explanation of keyword1

   keyword2:
  :    
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple
     lines)

Special Lines
-------------

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with `TITLE:`, `AUTHOR:`, and `DATE:` are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `at` with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the `and` with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
An email address can optionally be included, using the syntax

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
name Email: somename@site.net at institution1 and institution2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple authors require multiple `AUTHOR:` lines. All information
associated with `TITLE:` and `AUTHOR:` keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: November 9, 2016
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including `rst` and `sphinx`)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
Kaare Dump  (dump@cyb.space.com) [3]
A. Dummy Author

[1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
[2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
[3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

The current date can be specified as `today`.


*Table of Contents.* A table of contents can be generated by the line

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TOC: on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This line is usually placed after the `DATE:` line.
A value `off` turns off the table of contents.


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   * 9 `=` characters for chapters

   * 7 for sections

   * 5 for subsections

   * 3 for subsubsections

   * 2 *underscrores* (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by as many blanks as desired.

Doconce also supports abstracts. This is typeset as a paragraph, but
*must* be followed by a section heading (everything up to the first
section heading is taken as part of the text of the abstract).


Here are some examples:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
__Abstract.__ The following text just attempts to exemplify
various section headings.

========= Example on a Chapter Heading =========

Some text.


======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.


===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====

The running text goes here.

===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Special Lines
=============

Figures
-------


Figures are recognized by the special line syntax

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say `.eps` when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's `convert` utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for `TITLE:` and `AUTHOR:` lines, all information
related to a figure line *must be written on the same line*. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as `FIGURE:` will be
included in the formatted caption).

FIGURE:[figs/streamtubes, width=400] Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. {fig:viz}

Combining several image files into one, in a table fashion, can be done by the
`montage` program from the ImageMagick suite:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x \
        file1.png file2.png ... file4.png result.png
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The option `-tile XxY` gives `X` figures in the horizontal direction and
`Y` in the vertical direction (`tile 2x` means two figures per row
and `-tile x2` means two rows).

Movies
------

Here is an example on the `MOVIE:` keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the `latex`, `html`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<embed src="figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=600 height=470 autoplay="false" loop="true"></embed>
<p>
<em></em>
</p>




The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the `movie15` package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable `MOVIE15`. There is an associated variable
`EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER` which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
`myframes*.png`. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the `MOVIE:` command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



Copying Computer Code from Source Files
---------------------------------------

Another type of special lines starts with `@@@CODE` and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section [Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code](#e) below.


Inline Tagging
--------------


Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, _boldface phrases_,
and `verbatim text` (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as $\nu = \sin(x)$.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*emphasized words*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The line above gets typeset as
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between back-ticks:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The typesetting result looks like this:
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and `ptex2tex`) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing back-ticks and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which appears as some URL like [Search Google](http://google.com).
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in `.txt`, `.html`, `.pdf`, `.py`, `.f`,
`.f77`, `.f90`, `.f95`, `.sh`, `.csh`, `.ksh`, `.zsh`,
`.c`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.pl`, and `.java` follows the same
setup:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which appears as see the [Doconce Manual](manual.do.txt).
However, linking to local files like this needs caution:

  * In the `html` format the links work well if the files are
    supplied with the `.html` with the same relative location.

  * In the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats, such links in PDF files
    will unless the `.tex` file has a full URL specified through
    a `\hyperbaseurl` command and the linked files are located correctly
    relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.

  * In the `sphinx` format, local files to which there are links should only be
    located in a `_static` or `_static-name` subdirectory.

As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a `_static` or `_static-name` directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (`name` is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the `html` format is of relevance).

If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
`pygmentize`, e.g.,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
          -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then you can link to `_static/make.sh.html` instead of
`subdir/make.sh`. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as `src/myprog.py` in her
software and the document links to `_static/myprog.py`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See the code URL:"src/myprog.py" ("view: "_static/myprog.py.html").
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
*the filename as link text*. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
URL: "manual.html"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

resulting in the link <manual.html>.


Similarly, to have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

resulting in Click on this link: <http://code.google.com/p/doconce>.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[name: comment]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where `name` is the name of the author of the command, and `comment` is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless `doconce format`
is run with a command-line argument `--skip_inline_comments`
(see the chapter [From Doconce to Other Formats](#s) for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the `.do.txt` file
(see the chapter [From Doconce to Other Formats](#s)).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (`latex`, `pdflatex`, `html`,
`sphinx`, `mwiki`), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$, where $\bf A$
is an $n\times n$ matrix, and $\bf x$ and $\bf b$
are vectors of length $n$."

Comments
--------

Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as *inline comments* in Doconce and described
in the section [Inline Tagging](#g).

Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash `#`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
# These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
#
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Such comment lines may have some side effects in the `rst` and `sphinx`
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.

The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out *before*
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash `##` and lines enclosed by
the `<%doc>` (beginning) and `<%doc/>` (closing) tags.

If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.


Cross-Referencing
-----------------

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
`rst` and `sphinx` formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by `doconce format`. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure ref{fig:viz}
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections [LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text](#t) and [Macros (Newcommands)](#s)) are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section [Inline Tagging](#g).

Index and Bibliography
----------------------

An index can be created for the `latex`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats
by the `idx` keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
idx{some index entry}
idx{main entry!subentry}
idx{`verbatim_text` and more}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: `idx`
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding `cite` command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
as found in [3][14]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

if `Larsen_1986` has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and `Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999` is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword `BIBFILE:`,
followed by a BibTeX file with extension `.bib`,
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension `.rst`,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension `.py`.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{
'Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999': """
K. Nielsen and A. Kjeldstrup. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
""",
'Larsen_1986':
"""
O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
*Personal Press*. 1986.
"""
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the `latex` and `pdflatex` formats, the `.bib` file will be used in
the standard BibTeX way.  In the `rst` and `sphinx` formats, the
`.rst` file will be copied into the document at the place where the
`BIBFILE:` keyword appears, while all other formats will make use of
the Python dictionary typeset as an ordered Doconce list inserted at
the `BIBFILE:` line in the document.

Only one file with bibliographic references can be used. It is recommended
to create all references in BibTeX format. Say the file is `myfile.bib`.
Insert `BIBFILE: myfile.bib` at the end of the file (for instance).
Then make a LaTeX document and check that the references appear correctly.
A next step can be to create the `.rst` file, either by manual editing
of `myfile.bbl` or using `doconce bbl2rst myfile.bbl` to automate (most of)
this editing. From the `myfile.rst` file it is easy to create `myfile.py`
with the dictionary version of the references.


Conversion of BibTeX databases to reST format can be
done by the [bibliograph.parsing](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/) tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book @Python:Primer:09, a paper @Osnes:98,
and both of them simultaneously @Python:Primer:09;@Osnes:98.

[somereader: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) ]


Tables
------

A table like


    time        velocity    acceleration  
------------  ------------  ------------  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  


is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters `c`, `r`, or `l` to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes `|` can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (`rst` and `sphinx` are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



Exercises, Problems, or Projects
--------------------------------

Doconce has special support for three types of "exercises", named
*exercise*, *problem*, or *project*.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 `=` characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word "Exercise", "Problem", or "Project", followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
\label{proj:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf
solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt

Here goes the running text of the project....

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project *title*,
the *label*, the *result file*, the *solution* (if any of
these three entities is present), and the *running text*. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with `!bsubex` and ending
with `!esubex`, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) *answer*, and *hints*. The environments have begin-end
directives `!bans`, `!eans`, `!bsol`, `!esol`, `!bhint`, `!ehint`, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
`!bc` and `!ec`).

The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the `solution=...` directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.

A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
\label{exer:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf

Here goes the running text of the project....

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The various elements of exercises are collected in a special
data structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file `.mydoc.exerinfo`,
if `mydoc.do.txt` is the name of the Doconce file.

Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.

For now, exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
format). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The *title* is typeset without any leading "Exercise:", "Problem:",
or "Project:" word, so that references like "see Problem ref{...}"
works well in all formats.

It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)
under a section (or subsection) named "Exercises", "Problems", or
"Projects".


Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code
--------------------------------

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" `!bc` keyword and an "end code" `!ec` keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.

There may be an argument after the `!bc` tag to specify a
certain environment (for `ptex2tex` or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, `!bc dat` corresponds to
the data file environment and `!bc cod` is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for `ptex2tex` this means the `ccq` environment,
which is defined in the config file `.ptex2tex.cfg`,
while for Sphinx it defaults to the `python` environment).

Since the config file for `ptex2tex` can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after `!bc` is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, three arguments are defined: `pycod` for Python code,
`cod` also for Python code, `cppcod` for C++ code, and `sys`
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in `.ptex2tex.cfg` for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, `pro` is used for complete programs in Python, `cod` is
for a code snippet in Python, while `xcod` and `xpro` implies computer
language specific typesetting where `x` can be `f` for Fortran, `c`
for C, `cpp` for C++, `sh` for Unix shells, `pl` for Perl, `m` for
Matlab, `cy` for Cython, and `py` for Python.  The argument `sys`
means by default `console` for Sphinx and `CodeTerminal` (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are `dat` for a data file
or print out, and `ipy` for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in `sphinx` output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after `!bc` can be redefined in the
`.ptex2tex.cfg` configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
`sphinx code-blocks` comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.


The enclosing `!ec` tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (`pycod` style):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
# regular expressions for inline tags:
inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
INLINE_TAGS = {
    'emphasize':
    r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'verbatim':
    r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'bold':
    r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And here is a C++ code snippet (`cppcod` style):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Cpp}
void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
        myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 @@@CODE myfile.f
 @@@CODE myfile.f fromto: subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first line implies that all lines in the file `myfile.f` are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a `!bc Xpro` environment, where
`X` is the extension of the filename, here `f` (i.e., the environment
becomes `!bc fpro` and will typically lead to some Fortran-style
formatting in Linux and Sphinx).  The
second line has a `fromto:` directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc Xcod`
environment (again, `X` is the filename extension, implying the
type of file). Note that the `pro` and `cod` arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain `!bc` environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
`@` sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching `subroutine test`
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching `C END1` (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the `fromto:`
directive above:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Fortran}
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the "to" line is not copied into the Doconce file, but the
"from" line is. Sometimes it is convenient to also neglect the
"from" line, a feature that is allowed by replacing `fromto:` by
`from-to` ("from with minus"). This allows for copying very similar
code segments throughout a file, while still distinguishing between them.
Copying the second set of parameters from the text

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
# --- Start Example 1 ---
c = -1
A = 2
p0 = 4
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 1 ---

# --- Start Example 2 ---
c = -1
A = 1
p0 = 0
simulate_and_plot(c, A, p0)
# --- End Example 2 ---
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

is easy with

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
from-to: Start Example 2@End Example 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With only `fromto:` this would be impossible.

(Remark for those familiar with `ptex2tex`: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in `ptex2tex`. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
`.p.tex` file to be treated by `ptex2tex`. However, the `@@@CODE` line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by the mentioned
pro or cod environment which are defined in the `ptex2tex` configuration
file.)


LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text
---------------------------------

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is `!bt` (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
`!et`. It is important that `!bt` and `!et` appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$$
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
$$
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the result of the above `!bt` - `!et` block:
$$
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
$$

The support of LaTeX mathematics varies among the formats.  Output
`latex` and `pdflatex` has of course full support. The `html` format
supports single equations and multiple equations via the align
environment, also with labels. Although `sphinx`, like `html`, employs
MathJax, it does not support labels in align environments.  Markdown
(`pandoc` format) allows single equations and inline mathematics.
Going from Doconce to MS Word is most easily done by outputting in
the `latex` format and then using the Pandoc program to translate
from LaTeX to MS Word (note that only a subset of LaTeX will be
translated correctly).

If the document targets formats with and without support of LaTeX
mathematics, one can use the preprocessor to typeset the mathematics
in two versions. After `#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "html",
"sphinx", "mwiki", "pandoc")` one places LaTeX mathematics, and after
`#else` one can write inline mathematics in a way that looks nice in
plain text and wiki formats without support for mathematical
typesetting.


Mathematics for PowerPoint/OpenOffice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have LaTeX mathematics written in Doconce, it is fairly easy
to generate PNG images of all mathematical formulas and equations for
use with PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations.

 1. Make a Sphinx version of the Doconce file.

 2. Go to the Sphinx directory and load the `conf.py` file into
    a browser.

 3. Search for "math" and comment out the
    `'sphinx.ext.mathjax'` (enabled by default) and
    `'matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl'` (disabled by default)
    lines, and uncomment the `'sphinx.ext.pngmath'` package.
    This is the package that generates small PNG pictures
    of the mathematics.

 4. Uncomment the line with `pngmath_dvipng_args =` and
    set the PNG resolution to `-D 200` when the purpose is to
    generate mathematics pictures for slides.

 5. Run `make html`.

 6. Look at the HTML source file in the `_build/html`
    directory: all mathematics are in `img` tags with `src=`
    pointing to a PNG file and `alt=` pointing to the LaTeX
    source for the formula in question. This makes it very
    easy to find the PNG file that corresponding to a particular
    mathematical expression.

Macros (Newcommands)
--------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
`newcommand_replace.tex`:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
\newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
\newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
\newcommand{\Q}{\pmb{Q}}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and these in `newcommands_keep.tex`:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
\newcommand{\x}{\pmb{x}}
\newcommand{\normalvec}{\pmb{n}}
\newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LaTeX block

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0, \label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep   \label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

will then be rendered to
$$
\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u + f, \label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}
$$
in the current format.

Preprocessing Steps
-------------------

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>) and mako
(<http://www.makotemplates.org/>). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of `name=value` command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable `FORMAT`
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (`html`, `latex`,
`plain`, `rst`, `sphinx`, `epydoc`, `st`).  It is then easy to test on
the value of `FORMAT` and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
# If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
# PostScript files are used.

# #if FORMAT == "latex"
# Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
\begin{figure}
\label{fig:wavepackets}
  \begin{center}
#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
#  #endif

#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
#  #endif
  \end{center}
  \caption{
  Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
  }
\end{figure}

# #else

# Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.

# #endif
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section [From Doconce to Other Formats](#s).

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces
---------------------------------------

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form `#include "file.do.txt"`.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate `.rst` files and an index file listing the various `.rst`
that build up the document. To generate the various `.rst` files one
should not run Doconce on the individual `.do.txt` files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script `doconce split_rst`
to split the long, complete `.rst` into pieces. This process requires
that each `#include "file.do.txt` line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax `#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>`, where
`file` is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword `part:`.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is `master.do.txt`.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake_sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The autogenerated `automake_sphinx.sh` file (by `doconce sphinx_dir`)
is compatible with a master `.rst` file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to `doconce sphinx_dir`.
This set is the output of `doconce split_rst`, which we catch in a
variable `files` above.


Missing Features
----------------

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something line


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Python}
# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
# insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
# #else
# insert a Doconce-formatted "inline" table
# #endif
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# table of contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce `doconce format latex mydoc` to produce `mydoc.p.tex`. Then
we use the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst` commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `doconce replace from_text to_text filename` command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the `replace` method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with `\tableofcontents`, we should use `doconce subst`,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note the double backshlash in front of the `t` character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The `doconce subst` is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

Header and Footer
-----------------

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if `TITLE:` or
`#TITLE:` is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


Emacs Doconce Formatter
-----------------------

The file `misc/.doconce-mode.el` in the Doconce source distribution
gives a "Doconce Editing Mode" in Emacs. The file is a rough edit of
the reST Editing Mode for Emacs. Some Doconce features are recognized,
but far from all, and sometimes portions of Doconce text just appear
as ordinary text.

Here is how to get the Doconce Editing Mode in Emacs.

*Step 1.* Download the Doconce tarball from `code.google.com/p/doconce`,
pack it out and go to the root directory.

*Step 2.* Copy the `doconce-mode.el` file to the home directory:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cp misc/.doconce-mode.el $HOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Step 3.* Add these lines to `$HOME/.emacs`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(load-file "~/hg/.doconce-mode.el")
(setq auto-mode-alist(cons '("\\.do\\.txt$" . doconce-mode) auto-mode-alist))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Emacs will now recognize files with extension `.do.txt` and enter
the Doconce Editing Mode.


Troubleshooting
===============

Disclaimer
----------

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running `doconce format`, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


General Problems
----------------

Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce automatically removes the file `__tmp.do.txt`, which is the
resulting of the preprocessing stge and the file to examine if
something goes wrong in this stage (i.e., when `mako` and/or
`preprocess` is run). Add the `--debug` flag at the end of the
`doconce` command to (both make a debug file and) avoid that
`__tmp.do.txt` is deleted.

Figure captions are incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

Preprocessor directives do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

Problems with boldface and emphasize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

Links to local directories do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links of the type

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
see the "examples directory": "src/examples"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

do not work well. You need to link to a specific HTML file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
see the "examples directory": "src/examples/index.html"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links are not typeset correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all formats will allow formatting of the links. Verbatim words
in links are allowed if the whole link is typeset in verbatim:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
see the directory "`examples`": "src/examples/index.html".
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

However, the following will not be typeset correctly:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
see the "`examples` directory": "src/examples/index.html"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The back-ticks must be removed, or the text can be reformulated as
in the line above it.


Inline verbatim code is not detected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure there is a space before the first back-tick.

Strange non-English characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the encoding of the `.do.txt` file with the Unix `file` command
or with

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt

Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wrong Norwegian charcters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Doconce documents have characters not in the standard ASCII set,
the format of the file must be LATIN1 and not UTF-8. See
the section "Strange non-English characters" above for how to
run `doconce change_encoding` to change the encoding of the Doconce file.

Inline verbatim text is not formatted correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure there is whitespace surrounding the text in back-ticks.

Too short underlining of reST headlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is a paragraph heading without
proceeding text before some section heading.


Found !bt but no tex blocks extracted (BUG)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message points to a bug, but has been resolved by removing blank lines
between the text and the first `!bt` (inserting the blanks again did not
trigger the error message again...).

Problems with code or Tex Blocks
--------------------------------

Code or math block errors in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First note that a code or math block must come after some plain
sentence (at least for successful output in reST), not directly
after a section/paragraph heading, table, comment, figure, or
movie, because the code or math block is indented and then become
parts of such constructions. Either the block becomes invisible or
error messages are issued.

Sometimes reST reports an "Unexpected indentation" at the beginning of
a code block. If you see a `!bc`, which should have been removed when
running `doconce format sphinx`, it is usually an error in the Doconce
source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if the
line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a question
mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a newline/space
after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among the
mentioned. Then `!bc` will most likely be replaced and a double colon
at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in reST to
indicate a verbatim block of text).

Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If `idx` commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

Something is wrong with a verbatim code block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check first that there is a "normal" sentence right before
the block (this is important for reST and similar
"ASCII-close" formats).

Code/TeX block is not shown in reST format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A comment right before a code or tex block will treat the whole
block also as a comment. It is important that there is normal
running text right before `!bt` and `!bc` environments.

Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the the section [Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code](#e) above.  Start the
`!bc` and `!ec` tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the `!bt` and `!et` tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


Problems with reST/Sphinx Output
--------------------------------

Lists do not appear in .rst files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

Warning about duplicate link names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Link names should be unique, but if (e.g.) "file" is used as link text
several places in a reST file, the links still work. The warning can
therefore be ignorned.

Inconsistent headings in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `rst2*.py` and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for `===`,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

No code environment appears before "bc ipy" blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `!bc ipy` directive behaves this way for `sphinx` output because
interactive sessions are automatically handled. If this is not
appropriate, shift to `!bc cod` or another specification of the
verbatim environment.

Problems with LaTeX Output
--------------------------

Error when running latex: You must have 'pygmentize' installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This message points to the use of the minted style for typesetting verbatim
code. You need to include the `-shell-escape` command-line argument when
running `latex` or `pdflatex`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
Terminal> latex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
Terminal> pdflatex -shell-escape file mydoc.tex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using `doconce ptex2tex` will turn on the minted style if specified as
environment on the command line, while using `ptex2tex` requires the
preprocessor option `-DMINTED` to turn on the minted package.
When this package is included, `latex` or `pdflatex` runs the
`pygmentize` program and the `shell-escape` option is required.

How can I use my fancy LaTeX environments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce supports only basic formatting elements (headings, paragraphs,
lists, etc.), while LaTeX users are used to fancy environments for, e.g.,
theorems. A flexible strategy is to typeset theorems
using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via `doconce replace`. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<%
theorem_counter = 4
%>

# begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}
<%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%>

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `.p.tex` output file now reads

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% begin theorem
\label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,
and this works in any format. In LaTeX we can use both the generated
numbers from Mako variables or we can use the labels.

The next step is to replace the `% begin ...` and `% end ...` lines with
the proper LaTeX expressions in the `.p.tex` file. Moreover, we
need to remove the paragraphs with *Theorem*.
The following Bash script does the job:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
file=mydoc.p.tex
thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
`mydoc.p.tex` file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.

The resulting `mydoc.tex` file now becomes

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\usepackage{theorem}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]

...

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:fundamental1}



Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
\end{theorem}

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even better, HTML output looks nice as well.

Note that Doconce supports fancy environments for verbatim code (for example,
the `ptex2tex` program with all its flexibility for choosing environments).


The LaTeX file does not compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\code{...}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in back-ticks in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

Inline verbatim gives error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if the inline verbatim contains typical LaTeX commands, e.g.,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
some text with `\usepackage{mypack}` is difficult because
ptex2tex will replace this by \code{\usepackage{mypack}} and
then replace this by
{\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\verb!\usepackage{mypack!}}
which is wrong because ptex2tex applies regex that don't
capture the second }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The remedy is to place verbatim LaTeX commands in verbatim
blocks - that is safe.



Errors in figure captions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Such errors typically arise from unbalanced curly braces, or dollar signs
around math, and similar LaTeX syntax errors.

(Note that verbatim font is likely to cause trouble inside figure captions,
but Doconce will automatically replace verbatim text in back-ticks by
a proper `texttt` command (since verbatim font constructions does not work
inside figure captions) and precede underscores by backslash.)

Chapters are ignored
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default LaTeX style is "article". If you chapters in the Doconce file,
you need to run `ptex2tex` with the option `-DBOOK` to set the LaTeX
documentstyle to "book".

I want to tune the top of the LaTeX file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The top of the LaTeX file, as generated by Doconce, is very simple.
If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:

1. Make a little Bash script that performs a series of
   `doconce subst` (regular expressions) or `doconce replace` (regular text)
   substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to
   repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).

2. Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate
   file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then
   one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This
   means that the `doconce format latex` command does not generate
   the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these
   files.
   Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro
   text and include the various text pieces in this file.
   To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files
   into LaTeX code, except the "top" Doconce file that includes the
   others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but
   replaced by the hand-written LaTeX "top" file.

Problems with gwiki Output
--------------------------

Strange nested lists in gwiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the `.gwiki` file directly.

Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

Problems with HTML Output
-------------------------

How can I change the layout of the HTML page?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard of way of controlling the HTML format is to use an
HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out `TITLE:` to get HTML without a header and footer). The
`--html-template=filename` command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have "slots" for a title (`%(title)s`),
a date (`%(date)s`), and the main body of text (`%(main)s`).
For typesetting code, `pygments` is used (if installed) and can be
turned off by `--no-pygments-html` (leaving code in gray boxes).


The easiest way is to get fancy layouts in HTML is to
use the `sphinx` format and one its many themes.

A third, more primitive alternative is to edit the style in the top of
the HTML file (preferably done automatically via `doconce replace` and
`doconce subst` in the script that generates the final documents).

Why do figures look ugly when using HTML templates?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML header that Doconce generates contain special styles for
figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using
templates these styles are not defined, resulting in a rule that
spans the width and a centered caption. Changing the appearance
of the rule and caption can either be done by inserting styles or
simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
doconce replace '<p class="caption">' \
 '<p style="width: 50%; font-style: italic; color: blue">' mydoc.html
doconce replace '<hr class="figure">' \
 '<hr style="width: 50%">' mydoc.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debugging
---------

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
`_doconce_debugging.log`, if the to `doconce format` after the filename
is `debug`. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



Basic Parsing Ideas
===================


The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that `argument`, `keyword argument`, `return`,
`instance variable`, `class variable`, and `module variable` are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - argument x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
    - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
    - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
    - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
    - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
      (bool variable).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    module variable x:
  :    
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.

    module variable tolerance:
  :    
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

======= Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies =======

===== Doconce =====

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at URL:
"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".  Its installation from the
Mercurial (`hg`) source follows the standard procedure:
!bc sys
# Doconce
hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
!ec
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
!bc sys
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
!ec

Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
!bc sys
sudo apt-get install doconce
!ec
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
!bc sys
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
!ec

===== Dependencies =====

=== Preprocessors ===

If you make use of the "Preprocess": "http://code.google.com/p/preprocess"
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

!bc sys
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
!ec

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
"Mako": "http://www.makotemplates.org". Its installation is most
conveniently done by `pip`,

!bc sys
pip install Mako
!ec
This command requires `pip` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install python-pip
!ec
Alternatively, one can install from the `pip` "source code": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip".

=== Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output ===

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need "ptex2tex": "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex",
which is installed by

!bc sys
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
!ec
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, `cp2texmf.sh`:

!bc sys
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
!ec
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
!ec
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the `~/texmf/tex/latex/misc` directory).

Note that the `doconce ptex2tex` command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the `ptex2tex`
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by `ptex2tex` and `doconce ptext2tex`
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package "Pygments": "http://pygments.org"
to be installed:
!bc sys
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
!ec

If you use the minted style together with `ptex2tex`, you have to
enable it by the `-DMINTED` command-line argument to `ptex2tex`.  All
use of the minted style requires the `-shell-escape` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., `latex -shell-escape` or `pdflatex
-shell-escape`.

# Say something about anslistings.sty

=== reStructuredText (reST) Output ===

The `rst` output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the "docutils":
"http://docutils.sourceforge.net" package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

!bc sys
svn checkout http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
!ec
To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
!bc sys
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
!ec

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
"rst2pdf": "http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf". Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the `rst2pdf` directory and
run the usual `sudo python setup.py install`.


Output to `sphinx` requires of course "Sphinx": "http://sphinx.pocoo.org",
installed by
!bc sys
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
!ec

=== Markdown and Pandoc Output ===

The Doconce format `pandoc` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the `pandoc` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of "Pandoc":
"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/", written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install pandoc
!ec

=== Epydoc Output ===

When the output format is `epydoc` one needs that program too, installed
by
!bc sys
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
!ec

__Remark.__ Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
`apt-get install` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For `svn` directories, go to the directory,
run `svn update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`. For
Mercurial (`hg`) directories, go to the directory, run
`hg pull; hg update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`.

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.1.3 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.1.3 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [0.6]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

<TITLE>Demo of Doconce formats</TITLE>
<H3>Doconce demo</H3>

Doconce is a minimum tagged markup language. The file
<a href="quickref.do.txt">quickref.do.txt</a> is the source of the
Doconce quickref, written in the Doconce format.
Running
<pre>
doconce format html quickref.do.txt
</pre>
produces the HTML file <a href="quickref.html">quickref.html</a>.
Going from Doconce to LaTeX is done by
<pre>
doconce format latex quickref.do.txt
</pre>
resulting in the file <a href="quickref.tex">quickref.tex</a>, which can
be compiled to a PDF file <a href="quickref.pdf">quickref.pdf</a>
by running <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>dvipdf</tt> the standard way.
<p>
The reStructuredText (reST) format is of particular interest:
<pre>
doconce format rst    quickref.do.txt  # standard reST
doconce format sphinx quickref.do.txt  # Sphinx extension of reST
</pre>
The reST file <a href="quickref.rst">quickref.rst</a> is a starting point
for conversion to many other formats: OpenOffice,
<a href="quickref.xml">XML</a>, <a href="quickref.rst.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="quickref.rst.tex">LaTeX</a>,
and from LaTeX to <a href="quickref.rst.pdf">PDF</a>.
The <a href="quickref.sphinx.rst">Sphinx</a> dialect of reST
can be translated to <a href="quickref.sphinx.pdf">PDF</a>
and <a href="html/index.html">HTML</a>.
<p>
Doconce can also be converted to
<a href="quickref.gwiki">Googlecode wiki</a>,
<a href="quickref.mwiki">MediaWiki</a>,
<a href="quickref.cwiki">Creole wiki</a>,
<a href="quickref.mkd">a Pandoc</a>,
<a href="quickref.st">Structured Text</a>,
<a href="quickref.epytext">Epytext</a>,
and maybe the most important format of all:

TITLE: Doconce Quick Reference
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Simula Research Laboratory and University of Oslo
DATE: today
TOC: on

# Very preliminary

_WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!_


===== Supported Formats =====

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)
 * HTML (format `html`)
 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)
 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)
 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)
 * MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format `mwiki`)
 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)
 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)
 * StructuredText (format `st`)

The best supported formats are `latex`, `sphinx`, `html`, and `plain`.

===== Title, Authors, and Date =====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
!bc
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
!ec
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
!bc
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2
!ec
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Feb 22, 2016`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


===== Section Types =====
label{quick:sections}

|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
| abstract                | `__Abstract.__` Running text...       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more `=` signs of the
next heading.

===== Inline Formatting =====

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` become _boldface_.

===== Lists =====

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.
!bc
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
!ec
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line


===== Comments =====

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes `##` or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives `%<doc>` (beginning) and `<%doc/>` (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax
!bc
[name: running text]
!ec
where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running
!bc sys
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
!ec
removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired:
!bc sys
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
!ec
This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

===== Verbatim/Computer Code =====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
!bc
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
!ec
resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment
!bc
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
!ec
that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

# When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise
# ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
!bc
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
!ec
The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active
for `latex` and `sphinx` outout.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

===== LaTeX Mathematics =====

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `sphinx`, `latex`, and `pdflatex`
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
!bc
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
!ec
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example,
!bc
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
!et
!ec
will appear as
!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
!et

One can use `#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")` to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or (`#else`) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
or `html` formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in `latex` and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:

  * Use only the equation environments `\[`, `\]`,
    `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, and `align*`.
  * Labels in multiple equation environments such as `align` are
    not (yet) handled by `sphinx` and `pandoc`, so avoid inserting
    labels and referring  to equation labels in `align` environments.
    Actually, `align*` is the preferred environment for multiple equations.
  * LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
    Allowing other output formats, such as `sphinx`, makes it necessary
    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
    the format (typically `# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
    include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
    PDF document.

===== Figures and Movies =====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
!bc
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

!ec
Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
`convert` and `montage` programs from the ImageMagick suite:
!bc sys
montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png

convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png
!ec
Use `+append` for stacking left to right, `-append` for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by `-gravity`.


===== Tables =====

The table in Section ref{quick:sections} was written with this
syntax:
!bc
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
!ec

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

===== Labels, References, Citations, and Index =====

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
!bc
label{name}
!ec
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, say `a:b:c`, where `a` and `b` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
`c` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label `name` is written as
!bc
ref{name}
!ec
again with no backslash before `ref`.

Single citations are written as
!bc
cite{name}
!ec
where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
!bc
cite{name1,name2,name3}
!ec

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py`, where `name` is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
`name.do.txt`), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the `BIBFILE` keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
!bc
index{name}
!ec
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`, `rst`, and
`sphinx` formats.

===== Capabilities of the "doconce" Program =====

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

@@@CODE doconce_program.sh

===== Exercises =====

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, and *Project*. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or
    "Project:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
!bc
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
!ec
An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:
!bc
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
!ec
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

===== Labels, Index, and Citations =====

===== Preprocessing =====

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

!bc
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
!ec

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An "example document": "http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/" contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

<h3>Supported Formats  <a name="___sec0"></a></h3>
<p>
Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> LaTeX (format <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>pdflatex</tt>)
 <li> HTML (format <tt>html</tt>)
 <li> reStructuredText (format <tt>rst</tt>)
 <li> plain (untagged) ASCII (format <tt>plain</tt>)
 <li> Sphinx (format <tt>sphinx</tt>)
 <li> (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format <tt>pandoc</tt>)
 <li> Googlecode wiki (format <tt>gwiki</tt>)
 <li> MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format <tt>mwiki</tt>)
 <li> Creoloe wiki (format <tt>cwiki</tt>)
 <li> Epydoc (format <tt>epydoc</tt>)
 <li> StructuredText (format <tt>st</tt>)
</ul>

The best supported formats are <tt>latex</tt>, <tt>sphinx</tt>, <tt>html</tt>, and <tt>plain</tt>.

<p>

<h3>Title, Authors, and Date  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>
<p>
A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

<p>
The date can be set as any text different from <tt>today</tt> if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., <tt>Feb 22, 2016</tt>.

<p>
The table of contents is removed by writing <tt>TOC: off</tt>.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Section Types <a name="quick:sections"></a>  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>
<p>

<p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>                        Section type                       </b></td> <td align="center"><b>                           Syntax                          </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   chapter                                                        </td> <td align="left">   <tt>========= Heading  <a name="___sec3"></a>========</tt> (9 <tt>=</tt>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   section                                                        </td> <td align="left">   <tt>======= Heading  <a name="___sec4"></a>=======</tt>    (7 <tt>=</tt>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsection                                                     </td> <td align="left">   <tt>===== Heading  <a name="___sec5"></a>=====</tt>        (5 <tt>=</tt>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsubsection                                                  </td> <td align="left">   <tt>=== Heading  <a name="___sec6"></a>===</tt>            (3 <tt>=</tt>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   paragraph                                                      </td> <td align="left">   <tt>__Heading.__</tt>               (2 <tt>_</tt>)                           </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   abstract                                                       </td> <td align="left">   <tt>__Abstract.__</tt> Running text...                                </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with <tt>__Abstract.__</tt> at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more <tt>=</tt> signs of the
next heading.

<p>

<h3>Inline Formatting  <a name="___sec7"></a></h3>
<p>
Words surrounded by <tt>*</tt> are emphasized: <tt>*emphasized words*</tt> becomes
<em>emphasized words</em>. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: <tt>_boldface_</tt> become <b>boldface</b>.

<p>

<h3>Lists  <a name="___sec8"></a></h3>
<p>
There are three types of lists: <em>bullet lists</em>, where each item starts
with <tt>*</tt>, <em>enumeration lists</em>, where each item starts with <tt>o</tt> and gets
consqutive numbers,
and <em>description</em> lists, where each item starts with <tt>-</tt> followed
by a keyword and a colon.
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The code above follows.

<p>
Here is a bullet list:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> item1
 <li> item2

<ul>
  <li> subitem1 of item2
  <li> subitem2 of item2
</ul>

 <li> item3
</ul>

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

<p>

<ol>
<li> item1
<li> item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

<ol>
 <li> subitem1 of item2
 <li> subitem2 of item2
</ol>

<li> item3
</ol>

And finally a description list:

<p>

<dl>
 <dt>keyword1:<dd> 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 <dt>keyword2:<dd> 
   followed by text on the next line
 <dt>keyword3:<dd> 
   and its description may fit on one line
</dl>

<h3>Comments  <a name="___sec9"></a></h3>
<p>
Lines starting with <tt>#</tt> are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats <tt>rst</tt> and
<tt>sphinx</tt> are desired.

<p>
When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes <tt>##</tt> or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives <tt>%<doc></tt> (beginning) and <tt><%doc/></tt> (end).

<p>
Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
[name: running text]
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
where <tt>name</tt> is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and <tt>running text</tt> is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

<p>
All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

<p>

<h3>Verbatim/Computer Code  <a name="___sec10"></a></h3>
<p>
Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
resulting in Some sentence with <tt>words in verbatim style</tt>.

<p>
Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between <tt>!bc xxx</tt> and <tt>!ec</tt> directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification <tt>xxx</tt> indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for <tt>xxx</tt> are
nothing, <tt>cod</tt> for a code snippet, <tt>pro</tt> for a complete program,
<tt>sys</tt> for a terminal session, <tt>dat</tt> for a data file (or output from a
program),
<tt>Xpro</tt> or <tt>Xcod</tt> for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming <tt>X</tt>, where <tt>X</tt> may be <tt>py</tt> for Python,
<tt>cy</tt> for Cython, <tt>sh</tt> for Bash or other Unix shells,
<tt>f</tt> for Fortran, <tt>c</tt> for C, <tt>cpp</tt> for C++, <tt>m</tt> for MATLAB,
<tt>pl</tt> for Perl. For output in <tt>latex</tt> one can let <tt>xxx</tt> reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the <tt>ptex2tex</tt> configuration file
(<tt>.ptex2tex.cfg</tt>). For <tt>sphinx</tt> output one can insert a comment
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
that maps environments (<tt>xxx</tt>) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what <tt>sphinx</tt> applies to typeset computer code).

<p>
The <tt>xxx</tt> specifier has only effect for <tt>latex</tt> and
<tt>sphinx</tt> output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

<p>
<!-- When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise -->
<!-- ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>@@@CODE</tt> identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file <tt>doconce_program.sh</tt>.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the <em>regular
expression</em> <tt>doconce clean</tt> up to, but not including the line
matching the <em>regular expression</em> <tt>^doconce split_rst</tt>.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

<p>
The copied line from file are in this example put inside <tt>!bc shpro</tt>
and <tt>!ec</tt> directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become <tt>!bc shcod</tt> and <tt>!ec</tt> when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension <tt>.X</tt>, the environment
becomes <tt>!bc Xpro</tt> or <tt>!bc Xcod</tt> for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (<tt>Xcod</tt> and <tt>Xpro</tt>) are only active
for <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>sphinx</tt> outout.

<p>
Important warnings:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 <li> Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.
</ul>

<h3>LaTeX Mathematics  <a name="___sec11"></a></h3>
<p>
Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats <tt>sphinx</tt>, <tt>latex</tt>, and <tt>pdflatex</tt>
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

<p>
Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
\( Ax=b \). To help increase readability in other formats than <tt>sphinx</tt>,
<tt>latex</tt>, and <tt>pdflatex</tt>, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

<p>
Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
<tt>!bt</tt>
and
<tt>!et</tt> ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
$$
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
will appear as
$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
$$

<p>
One can use <tt>#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")</tt> to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or (<tt>#else</tt>) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

<p>
Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the <tt>sphinx</tt>, <tt>pandoc</tt>,
or <tt>html</tt> formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in <tt>latex</tt> and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Use only the equation environments <tt>\[</tt>, <tt>\]</tt>,
    <tt>equation</tt>, <tt>equation*</tt>, <tt>align</tt>, and <tt>align*</tt>.
  <li> Labels in multiple equation environments such as <tt>align</tt> are
    not (yet) handled by <tt>sphinx</tt> and <tt>pandoc</tt>, so avoid inserting
    labels and referring  to equation labels in <tt>align</tt> environments.
    Actually, <tt>align*</tt> is the preferred environment for multiple equations.
  <li> LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
    Allowing other output formats, such as <tt>sphinx</tt>, makes it necessary
    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
    the format (typically <tt># #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")</tt>) to
    include special code for <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>pdflatex</tt> output and more
    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
    PDF document.

<h3>Figures and Movies  <a name="___sec12"></a></h3>
<p>
Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. \label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. \label{some:fig:label}

</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

<p>
The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

<p>
Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

<p>
Combining several image files into one can be done by the
<tt>convert</tt> and <tt>montage</tt> programs from the ImageMagick suite:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  sys-->
<pre>
montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png

convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Use <tt>+append</tt> for stacking left to right, <tt>-append</tt> for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by <tt>-gravity</tt>.

<p>

<p>

<h3>Tables  <a name="___sec13"></a></h3>
<p>
The table in the section <a href="#quick:sections">Section Types</a> was written with this
syntax:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
Note that

<p>

<ul>
 <li> Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 <li> Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 <li> There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 <li> If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 <li> Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.
</ul>

<h3>Labels, References, Citations, and Index  <a name="___sec14"></a></h3>
<p>
The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
\label{name}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose <tt>name</tt>
as some hierarchical name, say <tt>a:b:c</tt>, where <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
<tt>c</tt> is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

<p>
A reference to the label <tt>name</tt> is written as
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
ref{name}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
again with no backslash before <tt>ref</tt>.

<p>
Single citations are written as
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
cite{name}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
where <tt>name</tt> is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have <tt>name</tt> on the form
<tt>Author1_Author2_YYYY</tt>, <tt>Author_YYYY</tt>, or <tt>Author1_etal_YYYY</tt>, where
<tt>YYYY</tt> is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
cite{name1,name2,name3}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
The bibliography is specified by a line <tt>BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py</tt>, where <tt>name</tt> is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
<tt>name.do.txt</tt>), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the <tt>BIBFILE</tt> keyword appears.

<p>
Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
index{name}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the <tt>latex</tt>, <tt>rst</tt>, and
<tt>sphinx</tt> formats.

<p>

<h3>Capabilities of the "doconce" Program  <a name="___sec15"></a></h3>
<p>
The <tt>doconce</tt> program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a <tt>.do.txt</tt> file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  shpro-->

<h3>Exercises  <a name="___sec16"></a></h3>
<p>
Doconce supports <em>Exercise</em>, <em>Problem</em>, and <em>Project</em>. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain <em>elements</em>:

<p>

<ul>
  <li> a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or
    "Project:", followed by a title (required)
  <li> a label (optional)
  <li> a solution file (optional)
  <li> name of file with a student solution (optional)
  <li> main exercise text (required)
  <li> a short answer (optional)
  <li> a full solution (optional)
  <li> one or more hints (optional)
  <li> one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)
</ul>

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
\label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
\label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

<p>

<h3>Labels, Index, and Citations  <a name="___sec17"></a></h3>
<p>

<h3>Preprocessing  <a name="___sec18"></a></h3>
<p>
Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either <tt>preprocess</tt> and/or
<tt>mako</tt>. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The <tt>mako</tt> preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

<p>
The command <tt>doconce format</tt> first runs <tt>preprocess</tt> and then <tt>mako</tt>.
Here is a typical example on utilizing <tt>preprocess</tt> to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

<p>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block -->
<pre>
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... \label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<p>
With the <tt>mako</tt> preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/">example document</a> contains
some illustrations on how to utilize <tt>mako</tt> (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the <tt>doc/src/make.sh</tt> script).

\subsection{Supported Formats}

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

\begin{itemize}
 \item {\LaTeX} (format \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex})

 \item HTML (format \code{html})

 \item reStructuredText (format \code{rst})

 \item plain (untagged) ASCII (format \code{plain})

 \item Sphinx (format \code{sphinx})

 \item (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format \code{pandoc})

 \item Googlecode wiki (format \code{gwiki})

 \item MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format \code{mwiki})

 \item Creoloe wiki (format \code{cwiki})

 \item Epydoc (format \code{epydoc})

 \item StructuredText (format \code{st})
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The best supported formats are \code{latex}, \code{sphinx}, \code{html}, and \code{plain}.

\subsection{Title, Authors, and Date}

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
\bccq
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
\eccq
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
\bccq
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2
\eccq
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from \code{today} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., \code{Feb 22, 2016}.

The table of contents is removed by writing \code{TOC: off}.

\subsection{Section Types}

\label{quick:sections}


\begin{quote}\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c}{Section type} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Syntax} \\
\hline
chapter                              & \code{========= Heading ========} (9 \code{=}) \\
section                              & \code{======= Heading =======}    (7 \code{=}) \\
subsection                           & \code{===== Heading =====}        (5 \code{=}) \\
subsubsection                        & \code{=== Heading ===}            (3 \code{=}) \\
paragraph                            & \code{__Heading.__}               (2 \code{_}) \\
abstract                             & \code{__Abstract.__} Running text...      \\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{quote}

\noindent
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with \code{__Abstract.__} at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more \code{=} signs of the
next heading.

\subsection{Inline Formatting}

Words surrounded by \code{*} are emphasized: \code{*emphasized words*} becomes
\emph{emphasized words}. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: \code{_boldface_} become \textbf{boldface}.

\subsection{Lists}

There are three types of lists: \emph{bullet lists}, where each item starts
with \code{*}, \emph{enumeration lists}, where each item starts with \code{o} and gets
consqutive numbers,
and \emph{description} lists, where each item starts with \code{-} followed
by a keyword and a colon.
\bccq
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
\eccq
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

\begin{itemize}
 \item item1

 \item item2
\begin{itemize}

  \item subitem1 of item2

  \item subitem2 of item2

\end{itemize}

\noindent
 \item item3
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

\begin{enumerate}
\item item1

\item item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
\begin{enumerate}

 \item subitem1 of item2

 \item subitem2 of item2

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\item item3
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
And finally a description list:

\begin{description}
 \item[keyword1:] 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 \item[keyword2:] 
   followed by text on the next line

 \item[keyword3:] 
   and its description may fit on one line
\end{description}

\noindent

\subsection{Comments}

Lines starting with \code{#} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before {\LaTeX} math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats \code{rst} and
\code{sphinx} are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes \code{##} or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives \code{%<doc>} (beginning) and \code{<%doc/>} (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax
\bccq
[name: running text]
\eccq
where \code{name} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and \code{running text} is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running
\bsys
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
\esys
removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired:
\bsys
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
\esys
This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

\subsection{Verbatim/Computer Code}

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
\bccq
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
\eccq
resulting in Some sentence with \code{words in verbatim style}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between \code{!bc xxx} and \code{!ec} directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification \code{xxx} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for \code{xxx} are
nothing, \code{cod} for a code snippet, \code{pro} for a complete program,
\code{sys} for a terminal session, \code{dat} for a data file (or output from a
program),
\code{Xpro} or \code{Xcod} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming \code{X}, where \code{X} may be \code{py} for Python,
\code{cy} for Cython, \code{sh} for Bash or other Unix shells,
\code{f} for Fortran, \code{c} for C, \code{cpp} for C++, \code{m} for MATLAB,
\code{pl} for Perl. For output in \code{latex} one can let \code{xxx} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the \code{ptex2tex} configuration file
(\code{.ptex2tex.cfg}). For \code{sphinx} output one can insert a comment
\bccq
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
\eccq
that maps environments (\code{xxx}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what \code{sphinx} applies to typeset computer code).

The \code{xxx} specifier has only effect for \code{latex} and
\code{sphinx} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

% When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise
% ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
\bccq
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
\eccq
The \code{@@@CODE} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file \code{doconce_program.sh}.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the \emph{regular
expression} \code{doconce clean} up to, but not including the line
matching the \emph{regular expression} \code{^doconce split_rst}.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside \code{!bc shpro}
and \code{!ec} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become \code{!bc shcod} and \code{!ec} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension \code{.X}, the environment
becomes \code{!bc Xpro} or \code{!bc Xcod} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (\code{Xcod} and \code{Xpro}) are only active
for \code{latex} and \code{sphinx} outout.

Important warnings:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 \item Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\subsection{{\LaTeX} Mathematics}

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard {\LaTeX} syntax. The output formats \code{sphinx}, \code{latex}, and \code{pdflatex}
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw {\LaTeX} code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
{\LaTeX} way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than \code{sphinx},
\code{latex}, and \code{pdflatex}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
\bccq
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
\eccq
That is, the {\LaTeX} expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of {\LaTeX} mathematics are written within
\code{!bt}
and
\code{!et} ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example,
\bccq
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
\eccq
will appear as
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}

One can use \code{#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")} to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in {\LaTeX} format
or (\code{#else}) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any {\LaTeX} syntax is accepted, but if output in the \code{sphinx}, \code{pandoc},
or \code{html} formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
{\LaTeX} constructs. For output both in \code{latex} and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use only the equation environments \code{\[}, \code{\]},
    \code{equation}, \code{equation*}, \code{align}, and \code{align*}.

  \item Labels in multiple equation environments such as \code{align} are
    not (yet) handled by \code{sphinx} and \code{pandoc}, so avoid inserting
    labels and referring  to equation labels in \code{align} environments.
    Actually, \code{align*} is the preferred environment for multiple equations.

  \item {\LaTeX} supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
    Allowing other output formats, such as \code{sphinx}, makes it necessary
    to only utilze very standard {\LaTeX} and avoid, for instance, more than
    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
    the format (typically \code{# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}) to
    include special code for \code{latex} and \code{pdflatex} output and more
    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
    also allow advanced {\LaTeX} features and fine tuning of resulting
    PDF document.
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\subsection{Figures and Movies}

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
\bccq
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

\eccq
Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
\code{convert} and \code{montage} programs from the ImageMagick suite:
\bsys
montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png

convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png
\esys
Use \code{+append} for stacking left to right, \code{-append} for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by \code{-gravity}.

\subsection{Tables}

The table in Section~\ref{quick:sections} was written with this
syntax:
\bccq
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
\eccq

Note that

\begin{itemize}
 \item Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 \item Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 \item There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 \item If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in {\LaTeX}.

 \item Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.
\end{itemize}

\noindent

\subsection{Labels, References, Citations, and Index}

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from {\LaTeX} with a very similar syntax. As in {\LaTeX}, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
\bccq
label{name}
\eccq
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose \code{name}
as some hierarchical name, say \code{a:b:c}, where \code{a} and \code{b} indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
\code{c} is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label \code{name} is written as
\bccq
ref{name}
\eccq
again with no backslash before \code{ref}.

Single citations are written as
\bccq
cite{name}
\eccq
where \code{name} is a logical name
of the reference (again, {\LaTeX} writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have \code{name} on the form
\code{Author1_Author2_YYYY}, \code{Author_YYYY}, or \code{Author1_etal_YYYY}, where
\code{YYYY} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
\bccq
cite{name1,name2,name3}
\eccq

The bibliography is specified by a line \code{BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py}, where \code{name} is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
\code{name.do.txt}), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the \code{BIBFILE} keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
\bccq
index{name}
\eccq
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the \code{latex}, \code{rst}, and
\code{sphinx} formats.

\subsection{Capabilities of the "doconce" Program}

The \code{doconce} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a \code{.do.txt} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

\bshpro
Usage: doconce command [optional arguments]
commands: format insertdocstr old2new_format gwiki_figsubst remove_inline_comments latin2html sphinx_dir subst replace replace_from_file clean help latex_header latex_footer guess_encoding change_encoding bbl2rst split_rst list_labels teamod sphinxfix_localURLs make_figure_code_links grab spellcheck ptex2tex expand_commands

doconce expand_commands file1 file2 ...
doconce list_labels doconcefile.do.txt | latexfile.tex
doconce teamod name
doconce assemble name master.do.txt
\eshpro

\subsection{Exercises}

Doconce supports \emph{Exercise}, \emph{Problem}, and \emph{Project}. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain \emph{elements}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or
    "Project:", followed by a title (required)

  \item a label (optional)

  \item a solution file (optional)

  \item name of file with a student solution (optional)

  \item main exercise text (required)

  \item a short answer (optional)

  \item a full solution (optional)

  \item one or more hints (optional)

  \item one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)
\end{itemize}

\noindent
A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
\bccq
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
\eccq
An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:
\bccq
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
\eccq
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

\subsection{Labels, Index, and Citations}

\subsection{Preprocessing}

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either \code{preprocess} and/or
\code{mako}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The \code{mako} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command \code{doconce format} first runs \code{preprocess} and then \code{mako}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing \code{preprocess} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

\bccq
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
\eccq

With the \code{mako} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An \href{{http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/}}{example document} contains
some illustrations on how to utilize \code{mako} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the \code{doc/src/make.sh} script).

**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**


Supported Formats
-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format ``latex`` and ``pdflatex``)

 * HTML (format ``html``)

 * reStructuredText (format ``rst``)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format ``plain``)

 * Sphinx (format ``sphinx``)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format ``pandoc``)

 * MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format ``mwiki``)

 * Creoloe wiki (format ``cwiki``)

 * Epydoc (format ``epydoc``)

 * StructuredText (format ``st``)

The best supported formats are ``latex``, ``sphinx``, ``html``, and ``plain``.

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from ``today`` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., ``Feb 22, 2016``.

The table of contents is removed by writing ``TOC: off``.

abstract                              ``__Abstract.__`` Running text...       
====================================  ====================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with ``__Abstract.__`` at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more ``=`` signs of the
next heading.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by ``*`` are emphasized: ``*emphasized words*`` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: ``_boldface_`` become **boldface**.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with ``*``, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with ``o`` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with ``-`` followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comments
--------

Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats ``rst`` and
``sphinx`` are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes ``##`` or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives ``%<doc>`` (beginning) and ``<%doc/>`` (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where ``name`` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and ``running text`` is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with ``words in verbatim style``.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between ``!bc xxx`` and ``!ec`` directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification ``xxx`` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for ``xxx`` are
nothing, ``cod`` for a code snippet, ``pro`` for a complete program,
``sys`` for a terminal session, ``dat`` for a data file (or output from a
program),
``Xpro`` or ``Xcod`` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming ``X``, where ``X`` may be ``py`` for Python,
``cy`` for Cython, ``sh`` for Bash or other Unix shells,
``f`` for Fortran, ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++, ``m`` for MATLAB,
``pl`` for Perl. For output in ``latex`` one can let ``xxx`` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ``ptex2tex`` configuration file
(``.ptex2tex.cfg``). For ``sphinx`` output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (``xxx``) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what ``sphinx`` applies to typeset computer code).

The ``xxx`` specifier has only effect for ``latex`` and
``sphinx`` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

.. When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise

.. ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...

Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst

The ``@@@CODE`` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file ``doconce_program.sh``.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* ``doconce clean`` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* ``^doconce split_rst``.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside ``!bc shpro``
and ``!ec`` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become ``!bc shcod`` and ``!ec`` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension ``.X``, the environment
becomes ``!bc Xpro`` or ``!bc Xcod`` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (``Xcod`` and ``Xpro``) are only active
for ``latex`` and ``sphinx`` outout.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats ``sphinx``, ``latex``, and ``pdflatex``
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than ``sphinx``,
``latex``, and ``pdflatex``, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
``!bt``
and
``!et`` ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example::


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
        \nabla\times u & 0.
        \end{align*}
        


will appear as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
        \nabla\times u & 0.
        \end{align*}


One can use ``#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")`` to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or (``#else``) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the ``sphinx``, ``pandoc``,
or ``html`` formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in ``latex`` and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:

  * Use only the equation environments ``\[``, ``\]``,
    ``equation``, ``equation*``, ``align``, and ``align*``.

  * Labels in multiple equation environments such as ``align`` are
    not (yet) handled by ``sphinx`` and ``pandoc``, so avoid inserting
    labels and referring  to equation labels in ``align`` environments.
    Actually, ``align*`` is the preferred environment for multiple equations.

  * LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
    Allowing other output formats, such as ``sphinx``, makes it necessary
    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
    the format (typically ``# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")``) to
    include special code for ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` output and more
    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
    PDF document.

*LaTeX Newcommands.* Text missing...


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
``convert`` and ``montage`` programs from the ImageMagick suite::


        montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
        montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
        montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png
        
        convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png

Use ``+append`` for stacking left to right, ``-append`` for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by ``-gravity``.


Tables
------

The table in the section `Section Types`_ was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

Labels, References, Citations, and Index
----------------------------------------

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose ``name``
as some hierarchical name, say ``a:b:c``, where ``a`` and ``b`` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
``c`` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label ``name`` is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ``ref``.

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where ``name`` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have ``name`` on the form
``Author1_Author2_YYYY``, ``Author_YYYY``, or ``Author1_etal_YYYY``, where
``YYYY`` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line ``BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py``, where ``name`` is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
``name.do.txt``), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the ``BIBFILE`` keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the ``latex``, ``rst``, and
``sphinx`` formats.

Capabilities of the "doconce" Program
-------------------------------------

The ``doconce`` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a ``.do.txt`` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::


        Usage: doconce command [optional arguments]
        commands: format insertdocstr old2new_format gwiki_figsubst remove_inline_comments latin2html sphinx_dir subst replace replace_from_file clean help latex_header latex_footer guess_encoding change_encoding bbl2rst split_rst list_labels teamod sphinxfix_localURLs make_figure_code_links grab spellcheck ptex2tex expand_commands

        doconce list_labels doconcefile.do.txt | latexfile.tex
        doconce teamod name
        doconce assemble name master.do.txt


Exercises
---------

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, and *Project*. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or
    "Project:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        !esubex

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

Labels, Index, and Citations

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either ``preprocess`` and/or
``mako``. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The ``mako`` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command ``doconce format`` first runs ``preprocess`` and then ``mako``.
Here is a typical example on utilizing ``preprocess`` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the ``mako`` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An `example document <http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>`_ contains
some illustrations on how to utilize ``mako`` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the ``doc/src/make.sh`` script).

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format ``latex`` and ``pdflatex``)

 * HTML (format ``html``)

 * reStructuredText (format ``rst``)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format ``plain``)

 * Sphinx (format ``sphinx``)

 * MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format ``mwiki``)

 * Creoloe wiki (format ``cwiki``)

 * Epydoc (format ``epydoc``)

 * StructuredText (format ``st``)

The best supported formats are ``latex``, ``sphinx``, ``html``, and ``plain``.

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

.. code-block:: py


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is

.. code-block:: py


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from ``today`` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., ``Feb 22, 2016``.

The table of contents is removed by writing ``TOC: off``.


.. _quick:sections:

Section Types
-------------

====================================  ====================================  
            Section type                             Syntax                 
====================================  ====================================  
chapter                               ``========= Heading ========`` (9 ``=``)  
section                               ``======= Heading =======``    (7 ``=``)  
subsection                            ``===== Heading =====``        (5 ``=``)  
subsubsection                         ``=== Heading ===``            (3 ``=``)  
paragraph                             ``__Heading.__``               (2 ``_``)  
abstract                              ``__Abstract.__`` Running text...       
====================================  ====================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with ``__Abstract.__`` at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more ``=`` signs of the
next heading.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by ``*`` are emphasized: ``*emphasized words*`` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: ``_boldface_`` become **boldface**.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with ``*``, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with ``o`` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with ``-`` followed
by a keyword and a colon.

.. code-block:: py


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comments
--------

Lines starting with ``#`` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats ``rst`` and
``sphinx`` are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes ``##`` or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives ``%<doc>`` (beginning) and ``<%doc/>`` (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax

.. code-block:: py


        [name: running text]

where ``name`` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and ``running text`` is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running

.. code-block:: console

        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired:

.. code-block:: console

        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in

.. code-block:: py


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with ``words in verbatim style``.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between ``!bc xxx`` and ``!ec`` directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification ``xxx`` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for ``xxx`` are
nothing, ``cod`` for a code snippet, ``pro`` for a complete program,
``sys`` for a terminal session, ``dat`` for a data file (or output from a
program),
``Xpro`` or ``Xcod`` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming ``X``, where ``X`` may be ``py`` for Python,
``cy`` for Cython, ``sh`` for Bash or other Unix shells,
``f`` for Fortran, ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++, ``m`` for MATLAB,
``pl`` for Perl. For output in ``latex`` one can let ``xxx`` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ``ptex2tex`` configuration file
(``.ptex2tex.cfg``). For ``sphinx`` output one can insert a comment

.. code-block:: py


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (``xxx``) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what ``sphinx`` applies to typeset computer code).

The ``xxx`` specifier has only effect for ``latex`` and
``sphinx`` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

.. When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise

.. ptex2tex is confused and starts copying...

Computer code can also be copied from a file:

.. code-block:: py


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst

The ``@@@CODE`` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file ``doconce_program.sh``.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* ``doconce clean`` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* ``^doconce split_rst``.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside ``!bc shpro``
and ``!ec`` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become ``!bc shcod`` and ``!ec`` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension ``.X``, the environment
becomes ``!bc Xpro`` or ``!bc Xcod`` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (``Xcod`` and ``Xpro``) are only active
for ``latex`` and ``sphinx`` outout.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats ``sphinx``, ``latex``, and ``pdflatex``
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
:math:`Ax=b`. To help increase readability in other formats than ``sphinx``,
``latex``, and ``pdflatex``, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like

.. code-block:: py


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
``!bt``
and
``!et`` ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example,

.. code-block:: py


        
.. math::
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
        \nabla\times u & 0.
        \end{align*}
        


will appear as

.. math::
        
        \nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
        \nabla\times u & 0.
        


One can use ``#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")`` to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or (``#else``) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the ``sphinx``, ``pandoc``,
or ``html`` formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in ``latex`` and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:

  * Use only the equation environments ``\[``, ``\]``,
    ``equation``, ``equation*``, ``align``, and ``align*``.

  * Labels in multiple equation environments such as ``align`` are
    not (yet) handled by ``sphinx`` and ``pandoc``, so avoid inserting
    labels and referring  to equation labels in ``align`` environments.
    Actually, ``align*`` is the preferred environment for multiple equations.

  * LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
    Allowing other output formats, such as ``sphinx``, makes it necessary
    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
    the format (typically ``# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")``) to
    include special code for ``latex`` and ``pdflatex`` output and more
    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
    PDF document.

*LaTeX Newcommands.* Text missing...


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:

.. code-block:: py


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
``convert`` and ``montage`` programs from the ImageMagick suite:

.. code-block:: console

        montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
        montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
        montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png
        
        convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png

Use ``+append`` for stacking left to right, ``-append`` for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by ``-gravity``.


Tables
------

The table in the section :ref:`quick:sections` was written with this
syntax:

.. code-block:: py


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

Labels, References, Citations, and Index
----------------------------------------

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax

.. code-block:: py


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose ``name``
as some hierarchical name, say ``a:b:c``, where ``a`` and ``b`` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
``c`` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label ``name`` is written as

.. code-block:: py


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ``ref``.

Single citations are written as

.. code-block:: py


        cite{name}

where ``name`` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have ``name`` on the form
``Author1_Author2_YYYY``, ``Author_YYYY``, or ``Author1_etal_YYYY``, where
``YYYY`` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:

.. code-block:: py


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line ``BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py``, where ``name`` is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
``name.do.txt``), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the ``BIBFILE`` keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)

.. code-block:: py


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the ``latex``, ``rst``, and
``sphinx`` formats.

Capabilities of the "doconce" Program
-------------------------------------

The ``doconce`` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a ``.do.txt`` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:


.. code-block:: bash

        Usage: doconce command [optional arguments]
        commands: format insertdocstr old2new_format gwiki_figsubst remove_inline_comments latin2html sphinx_dir subst replace replace_from_file clean help latex_header latex_footer guess_encoding change_encoding bbl2rst split_rst list_labels teamod sphinxfix_localURLs make_figure_code_links grab spellcheck ptex2tex expand_commands

        doconce subst [-s -m -x --restore] regex-pattern regex-replacement file1 file2 ...
        (-s is the re.DOTALL modifier, -m is the re.MULTILINE modifier,
         -x is the re.VERBOSE modifier, --restore copies backup files back again)
        
        doconce replace from-text to-text file1 file2 ...

        doconce list_labels doconcefile.do.txt | latexfile.tex
        doconce teamod name
        doconce assemble name master.do.txt


Exercises
---------

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, and *Project*. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or
    "Project:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:

.. code-block:: py


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

.. code-block:: py


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        !esubex

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

Labels, Index, and Citations

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either ``preprocess`` and/or
``mako``. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The ``mako`` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command ``doconce format`` first runs ``preprocess`` and then ``mako``.
Here is a typical example on utilizing ``preprocess`` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:


.. code-block:: py


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the ``mako`` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An `example document <http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>`_ contains
some illustrations on how to utilize ``mako`` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the ``doc/src/make.sh`` script).

#summary Doconce Quick Reference

By *Hans Petter Langtangen*

==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

<wiki: toc max_depth="2" />



<wiki:comment> Very preliminary </wiki:comment>

*WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!*

==== Supported Formats ====

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:


 * LaTeX (format `latex` and `pdflatex`)
 * HTML (format `html`)
 * reStructuredText (format `rst`)
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format `plain`)
 * Sphinx (format `sphinx`)
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format `pandoc`)
 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)
 * MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format `mwiki`)
 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)
 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)
 * StructuredText (format `st`)

The best supported formats are `latex`, `sphinx`, `html`, and `plain`.

==== Title, Authors, and Date ====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
}}}
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
{{{
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2
}}}
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Feb 22, 2016`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.

==== Section Types ====

 ||              *Section type*               ||                 *Syntax*                  ||
 ||  chapter                                  ||  `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)     ||
 ||  section                                  ||  `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)     ||
 ||  subsection                               ||  `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)     ||
 ||  subsubsection                            ||  `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)     ||
 ||  paragraph                                ||  `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)     ||
 ||  abstract                                 ||  `__Abstract.__` Running text...          ||


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more `=` signs of the
next heading.

==== Inline Formatting ====

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` become *boldface*.

==== Lists ====

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.
{{{
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
}}}
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


 * item1
 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:


# item1
# item2   may appear on   multiple lines

 # subitem1 of item2
 # subitem2 of item2


# item3

And finally a description list:


 * keyword1:  
   followed by   some text   over multiple   lines
 * keyword2:     followed by text on the next line
 * keyword3:  
   and its description may fit on one line

==== Comments ====

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes `##` or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives `%<doc>` (beginning) and `<%doc/>` (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax
{{{
[name: running text]
}}}
where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running
{{{
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
}}}
removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired:
{{{
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
}}}
This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

==== Verbatim/Computer Code ====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
{{{
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
}}}
resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

<wiki:comment> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... </wiki:comment>
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
{{{
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
}}}
The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active
for `latex` and `sphinx` outout.

Important warnings:


 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by   paragraphs with headings.

==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `sphinx`, `latex`, and `pdflatex`
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
`Ax=b`. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
{{{
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
}}}
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example,
{{{
{{{
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
}}}
}}}
will appear as
{{{
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
}}}

One can use `#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")` to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or (`#else`) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
or `html` formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in `latex` and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:


  * Use only the equation environments `\[`, `\]`,    `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, and `align*`.
  * Labels in multiple equation environments such as `align` are    not (yet) handled by `sphinx` and `pandoc`, so avoid inserting    labels and referring  to equation labels in `align` environments.    Actually, `align*` is the preferred environment for multiple equations.
  * LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.    Allowing other output formats, such as `sphinx`, makes it necessary    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on    the format (typically `# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to    include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting    PDF document.

*LaTeX Newcommands.* Text missing...

==== Figures and Movies ====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
{{{
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

}}}
Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
`convert` and `montage` programs from the ImageMagick suite:
{{{
montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png

convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png
}}}
Use `+append` for stacking left to right, `-append` for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by `-gravity`.

==== Tables ====

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
{{{
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
}}}

Note that


 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment   have no effect.

==== Labels, References, Citations, and Index ====

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
{{{
label{name}
}}}
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, say `a:b:c`, where `a` and `b` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
`c` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label `name` is written as
{{{
ref{name}
}}}
again with no backslash before `ref`.

Single citations are written as
{{{
cite{name}
}}}
where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
{{{
cite{name1,name2,name3}
}}}

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py`, where `name` is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
`name.do.txt`), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the `BIBFILE` keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
{{{
index{name}
}}}
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`, `rst`, and
`sphinx` formats.

==== Capabilities of the "doconce" Program ====

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

{{{
Usage: doconce command [optional arguments]
commands: format insertdocstr old2new_format gwiki_figsubst remove_inline_comments latin2html sphinx_dir subst replace replace_from_file clean help latex_header latex_footer guess_encoding change_encoding bbl2rst split_rst list_labels teamod sphinxfix_localURLs make_figure_code_links grab spellcheck ptex2tex expand_commands

doconce expand_commands file1 file2 ...
doconce list_labels doconcefile.do.txt | latexfile.tex
doconce teamod name
doconce assemble name master.do.txt
}}}

==== Exercises ====

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, and *Project*. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain *elements*:


  * a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or    "Project:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
{{{
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
}}}
An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:
{{{
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
}}}
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

==== Labels, Index, and Citations ====

==== Preprocessing ====

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

{{{
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
}}}

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/ example document] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

==== Resources ====

************** File: quickref.mwiki *****************
#TITLE (actually governed by the filename): Doconce Quick Reference

By '''Hans Petter Langtangen'''

==== Jan 32, 2100 ====

''TOC'' <!--> Very preliminary -->

'''WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!'''

==== Supported Formats ====

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:


<ul>
 <li> LaTeX (format <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code>) <li> HTML (format <code>html</code>) <li> reStructuredText (format <code>rst</code>) <li> plain (untagged) ASCII (format <code>plain</code>) <li> Sphinx (format <code>sphinx</code>) <li> (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format <code>pandoc</code>) <li> Googlecode wiki (format <code>gwiki</code>) <li> MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format <code>mwiki</code>) <li> Creoloe wiki (format <code>cwiki</code>) <li> Epydoc (format <code>epydoc</code>) <li> StructuredText (format <code>st</code>)</ul>

The best supported formats are <code>latex</code>, <code>sphinx</code>, <code>html</code>, and <code>plain</code>.

==== Title, Authors, and Date ====

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
<code>
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
</code>
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
<code>
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2
</code>
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from <code>today</code> if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., <code>Feb 22, 2016</code>.

The table of contents is removed by writing <code>TOC: off</code>.

==== Section Types ====

<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>            Section type            </b></td> <td align="center"><b>               Syntax               </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   chapter                                 </td> <td align="left">   <code>========= Heading ========</code> (9 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   section                                 </td> <td align="left">   <code>======= Heading =======</code>    (7 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsection                              </td> <td align="left">   <code>===== Heading =====</code>        (5 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   subsubsection                           </td> <td align="left">   <code>=== Heading ===</code>            (3 <code>=</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   paragraph                               </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Heading.__</code>               (2 <code>_</code>)    </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   abstract                                </td> <td align="left">   <code>__Abstract.__</code> Running text...         </td> </tr>
</table>
Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with <code>__Abstract.__</code> at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more <code>=</code> signs of the
next heading.

==== Inline Formatting ====

Words surrounded by <code>*</code> are emphasized: <code>*emphasized words*</code> becomes
''emphasized words''. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: <code>_boldface_</code> become '''boldface'''.

==== Lists ====

There are three types of lists: ''bullet lists'', where each item starts
with <code>*</code>, ''enumeration lists'', where each item starts with <code>o</code> and gets
consqutive numbers,
and ''description'' lists, where each item starts with <code>-</code> followed
by a keyword and a colon.
<code>
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
</code>
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


<ul>
 <li> item1 <li> item2
<ul>
  <li><li> subitem1 of item2  <li><li> subitem2 of item2</ul>

 <li> item3</ul>

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:


<ol>
<li> item1<li> item2   may appear on   multiple lines
<ol>
 <li><li> subitem1 of item2 <li><li> subitem2 of item2</ol>

<li> item3</ol>

And finally a description list:


<dl>
 <dt>keyword1:<dd> 
   followed by   some text   over multiple   lines <dt>keyword2:<dd>    followed by text on the next line <dt>keyword3:<dd> 
   and its description may fit on one line</dl>

==== Comments ====

Lines starting with <code>#</code> are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats <code>rst</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes <code>##</code> or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives <code>%<doc></code> (beginning) and <code><%doc/></code> (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax
<code>
[name: running text]
</code>
where <code>name</code> is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and <code>running text</code> is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
</code>
removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
</code>
This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

==== Verbatim/Computer Code ====

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
<code>
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
</code>
resulting in Some sentence with <code>words in verbatim style</code>.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between <code>!bc xxx</code> and <code>!ec</code> directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification <code>xxx</code> indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for <code>xxx</code> are
nothing, <code>cod</code> for a code snippet, <code>pro</code> for a complete program,
<code>sys</code> for a terminal session, <code>dat</code> for a data file (or output from a
program),
<code>Xpro</code> or <code>Xcod</code> for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming <code>X</code>, where <code>X</code> may be <code>py</code> for Python,
<code>cy</code> for Cython, <code>sh</code> for Bash or other Unix shells,
<code>f</code> for Fortran, <code>c</code> for C, <code>cpp</code> for C++, <code>m</code> for MATLAB,
<code>pl</code> for Perl. For output in <code>latex</code> one can let <code>xxx</code> reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the <code>ptex2tex</code> configuration file
(<code>.ptex2tex.cfg</code>). For <code>sphinx</code> output one can insert a comment
<code>
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
</code>
that maps environments (<code>xxx</code>) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what <code>sphinx</code> applies to typeset computer code).

The <code>xxx</code> specifier has only effect for <code>latex</code> and
<code>sphinx</code> output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

<!--> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise -->
<!--> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... -->
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
<code>
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
</code>
The <code>@@@CODE</code> identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file <code>doconce_program.sh</code>.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the ''regular
expression'' <code>doconce clean</code> up to, but not including the line
matching the ''regular expression'' <code>^doconce split_rst</code>.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside <code>!bc shpro</code>
and <code>!ec</code> directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become <code>!bc shcod</code> and <code>!ec</code> when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension <code>.X</code>, the environment
becomes <code>!bc Xpro</code> or <code>!bc Xcod</code> for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (<code>Xcod</code> and <code>Xpro</code>) are only active
for <code>latex</code> and <code>sphinx</code> outout.

Important warnings:


<ul>
 <li> A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,   table, comment, figure, or movie. <li> Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by   paragraphs with headings.</ul>

==== LaTeX Mathematics ====

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats <code>sphinx</code>, <code>latex</code>, and <code>pdflatex</code>
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
<math>Ax=b</math>. To help increase readability in other formats than <code>sphinx</code>,
<code>latex</code>, and <code>pdflatex</code>, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
<code>
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
</code>
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
<code>!bt</code>
and
<code>!et</code> ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example,
<code>
:<math>
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
</math>
</code>
will appear as
:<math>
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
</math>

One can use <code>#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")</code> to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or (<code>#else</code>) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the <code>sphinx</code>, <code>pandoc</code>,
or <code>html</code> formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in <code>latex</code> and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:


<ul>
  <li> Use only the equation environments <code>\[</code>, <code>\]</code>,    <code>equation</code>, <code>equation*</code>, <code>align</code>, and <code>align*</code>.  <li> Labels in multiple equation environments such as <code>align</code> are    not (yet) handled by <code>sphinx</code> and <code>pandoc</code>, so avoid inserting    labels and referring  to equation labels in <code>align</code> environments.    Actually, <code>align*</code> is the preferred environment for multiple equations.  <li> LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.    Allowing other output formats, such as <code>sphinx</code>, makes it necessary    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on    the format (typically <code># #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")</code>) to    include special code for <code>latex</code> and <code>pdflatex</code> output and more    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting    PDF document.</ul>

''LaTeX Newcommands.'' Text missing...

==== Figures and Movies ====

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
<code>
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

</code>
Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
<code>convert</code> and <code>montage</code> programs from the ImageMagick suite:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png

convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png
</code>
Use <code>+append</code> for stacking left to right, <code>-append</code> for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by <code>-gravity</code>.

==== Tables ====

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
<code>
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
</code>

Note that


<ul>
 <li> Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol). <li> Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol). <li> There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns   (center, left, right). <li> If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX. <li> Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment   have no effect.</ul>

==== Labels, References, Citations, and Index ====

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
<code>
label{name}
</code>
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose <code>name</code>
as some hierarchical name, say <code>a:b:c</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
<code>c</code> is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label <code>name</code> is written as
<code>
ref{name}
</code>
again with no backslash before <code>ref</code>.

Single citations are written as
<code>
cite{name}
</code>
where <code>name</code> is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have <code>name</code> on the form
<code>Author1_Author2_YYYY</code>, <code>Author_YYYY</code>, or <code>Author1_etal_YYYY</code>, where
<code>YYYY</code> is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
<code>
cite{name1,name2,name3}
</code>

The bibliography is specified by a line <code>BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py</code>, where <code>name</code> is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
<code>name.do.txt</code>), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the <code>BIBFILE</code> keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
<code>
index{name}
</code>
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the <code>latex</code>, <code>rst</code>, and
<code>sphinx</code> formats.

==== Capabilities of the "doconce" Program ====

The <code>doconce</code> program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a <code>.do.txt</code> file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
Usage: doconce command [optional arguments]
commands: format insertdocstr old2new_format gwiki_figsubst remove_inline_comments latin2html sphinx_dir subst replace replace_from_file clean help latex_header latex_footer guess_encoding change_encoding bbl2rst split_rst list_labels teamod sphinxfix_localURLs make_figure_code_links grab spellcheck ptex2tex expand_commands

doconce expand_commands file1 file2 ...
doconce list_labels doconcefile.do.txt | latexfile.tex
doconce teamod name
doconce assemble name master.do.txt
</code>

==== Exercises ====

Doconce supports ''Exercise'', ''Problem'', and ''Project''. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain ''elements'':


<ul>
  <li> a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or    "Project:", followed by a title (required)  <li> a label (optional)  <li> a solution file (optional)  <li> name of file with a student solution (optional)  <li> main exercise text (required)  <li> a short answer (optional)  <li> a full solution (optional)  <li> one or more hints (optional)  <li> one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)</ul>

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
<code>
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
</code>
An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:
<code>
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
</code>
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

==== Labels, Index, and Citations ====

==== Preprocessing ====

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either <code>preprocess</code> and/or
<code>mako</code>. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The <code>mako</code> preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command <code>doconce format</code> first runs <code>preprocess</code> and then <code>mako</code>.
Here is a typical example on utilizing <code>preprocess</code> to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

<code>
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
</code>

With the <code>mako</code> preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/ example document] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize <code>mako</code> (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the <code>doc/src/make.sh</code> script).

#summary Doconce Quick Reference
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />
By **Hans Petter Langtangen**

=== Jan 32, 2100 ===

<<TableOfContents>>



<wiki:comment> Very preliminary </wiki:comment>

**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**


== Supported Formats ==

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:


 * LaTeX (format {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}})
 * HTML (format {{{html}}})
 * reStructuredText (format {{{rst}}})
 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format {{{plain}}})
 * Sphinx (format {{{sphinx}}})
 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format {{{pandoc}}})
 * Googlecode wiki (format {{{gwiki}}})
 * MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format {{{mwiki}}})
 * Creoloe wiki (format {{{cwiki}}})
 * Epydoc (format {{{epydoc}}})
 * StructuredText (format {{{st}}})

The best supported formats are {{{latex}}}, {{{sphinx}}}, {{{html}}}, and {{{plain}}}.


== Title, Authors, and Date ==

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads
{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
}}}
The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is
{{{
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2
}}}
where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from {{{today}}} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., {{{Feb 22, 2016}}}.

The table of contents is removed by writing {{{TOC: off}}}.


== Section Types ==

 | =Section type                             | =Syntax                                   |
 |  chapter                                  |  {{{========= Heading ========}}} (9 {{{=}}})     |
 |  section                                  |  {{{======= Heading =======}}}    (7 {{{=}}})     |
 |  subsection                               |  {{{===== Heading =====}}}        (5 {{{=}}})     |
 |  subsubsection                            |  {{{=== Heading ===}}}            (3 {{{=}}})     |
 |  paragraph                                |  {{{__Heading.__}}}               (2 {{{_}}})     |
 |  abstract                                 |  {{{__Abstract.__}}} Running text...          |


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with {{{__Abstract.__}}} at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more {{{=}}} signs of the
next heading.


== Inline Formatting ==

Words surrounded by {{{*}}} are emphasized: {{{*emphasized words*}}} becomes
//emphasized words//. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: {{{_boldface_}}} become **boldface**.


== Lists ==

There are three types of lists: //bullet lists//, where each item starts
with {{{*}}}, //enumeration lists//, where each item starts with {{{o}}} and gets
consqutive numbers,
and //description// lists, where each item starts with {{{-}}} followed
by a keyword and a colon.
{{{
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
}}}
The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:


 * item1
 * item2

  ** subitem1 of item2
  //* subitem2 of item2


 // item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:


# item1
# item2   may appear on   multiple lines

 ## subitem1 of item2
 ## subitem2 of item2


# item3

And finally a description list:


 * keyword1:  
   followed by   some text   over multiple   lines
 * keyword2:     followed by text on the next line
 * keyword3:  
   and its description may fit on one line


== Comments ==

Lines starting with {{{#}}} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats {{{rst}}} and
{{{sphinx}}} are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes {{{##}}} or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives {{{%<doc>}}} (beginning) and {{{<%doc/>}}} (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax
{{{
[name: running text]
}}}
where {{{name}}} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and {{{running text}}} is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running
{{{
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
}}}
removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired:
{{{
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
}}}
This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.


== Verbatim/Computer Code ==

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in
{{{
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
}}}
resulting in Some sentence with {{{words in verbatim style}}}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between {{{!bc xxx}}} and {{{!ec}}} directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification {{{xxx}}} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for {{{xxx}}} are
nothing, {{{cod}}} for a code snippet, {{{pro}}} for a complete program,
{{{sys}}} for a terminal session, {{{dat}}} for a data file (or output from a
program),
{{{Xpro}}} or {{{Xcod}}} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming {{{X}}}, where {{{X}}} may be {{{py}}} for Python,
{{{cy}}} for Cython, {{{sh}}} for Bash or other Unix shells,
{{{f}}} for Fortran, {{{c}}} for C, {{{cpp}}} for C++, {{{m}}} for MATLAB,
{{{pl}}} for Perl. For output in {{{latex}}} one can let {{{xxx}}} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the {{{ptex2tex}}} configuration file
({{{.ptex2tex.cfg}}}). For {{{sphinx}}} output one can insert a comment
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
that maps environments ({{{xxx}}}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what {{{sphinx}}} applies to typeset computer code).

The {{{xxx}}} specifier has only effect for {{{latex}}} and
{{{sphinx}}} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

<wiki:comment> When showing copy from file in !bc envir, intent a character - otherwise </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> ptex2tex is confused and starts copying... </wiki:comment>
Computer code can also be copied from a file:
{{{
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
}}}
The {{{@@@CODE}}} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file {{{doconce_program.sh}}}.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the //regular
expression// {{{doconce clean}}} up to, but not including the line
matching the //regular expression// {{{^doconce split_rst}}}.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside {{{!bc shpro}}}
and {{{!ec}}} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become {{{!bc shcod}}} and {{{!ec}}} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension {{{.X}}}, the environment
becomes {{{!bc Xpro}}} or {{{!bc Xcod}}} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments ({{{Xcod}}} and {{{Xpro}}}) are only active
for {{{latex}}} and {{{sphinx}}} outout.

Important warnings:


 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by   paragraphs with headings.


== LaTeX Mathematics ==

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats {{{sphinx}}}, {{{latex}}}, and {{{pdflatex}}}
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
{{{Ax=b}}}. To help increase readability in other formats than {{{sphinx}}},
{{{latex}}}, and {{{pdflatex}}}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like
{{{
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
}}}
That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
{{{!bt}}}
and
{{{!et}}} ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example,
{{{
{{{
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
}}}
}}}
will appear as
{{{
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
}}}

One can use {{{#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")}}} to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or ({{{#else}}}) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the {{{sphinx}}}, {{{pandoc}}},
or {{{html}}} formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in {{{latex}}} and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:


  * Use only the equation environments {{{\[}}}, {{{\]}}},    {{{equation}}}, {{{equation*}}}, {{{align}}}, and {{{align*}}}.
  * Labels in multiple equation environments such as {{{align}}} are    not (yet) handled by {{{sphinx}}} and {{{pandoc}}}, so avoid inserting    labels and referring  to equation labels in {{{align}}} environments.    Actually, {{{align*}}} is the preferred environment for multiple equations.
  * LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.    Allowing other output formats, such as {{{sphinx}}}, makes it necessary    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on    the format (typically {{{# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}}}) to    include special code for {{{latex}}} and {{{pdflatex}}} output and more    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting    PDF document.

== Figures and Movies ==

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:
{{{
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}

}}}
Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
{{{convert}}} and {{{montage}}} programs from the ImageMagick suite:
{{{
montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png

convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png
}}}
Use {{{+append}}} for stacking left to right, {{{-append}}} for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by {{{-gravity}}}.


== Tables ==

The table in the section [#Section_Types] was written with this
syntax:
{{{
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
| subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
| paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
}}}

Note that


 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns   (center, left, right).
 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment   have no effect.


== Labels, References, Citations, and Index ==

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax
{{{
label{name}
}}}
with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose {{{name}}}
as some hierarchical name, say {{{a:b:c}}}, where {{{a}}} and {{{b}}} indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
{{{c}}} is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label {{{name}}} is written as
{{{
ref{name}
}}}
again with no backslash before {{{ref}}}.

Single citations are written as
{{{
cite{name}
}}}
where {{{name}}} is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have {{{name}}} on the form
{{{Author1_Author2_YYYY}}}, {{{Author_YYYY}}}, or {{{Author1_etal_YYYY}}}, where
{{{YYYY}}} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:
{{{
cite{name1,name2,name3}
}}}

The bibliography is specified by a line {{{BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py}}}, where {{{name}}} is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
{{{name.do.txt}}}), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the {{{BIBFILE}}} keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)
{{{
index{name}
}}}
It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the {{{latex}}}, {{{rst}}}, and
{{{sphinx}}} formats.


== Capabilities of the "doconce" Program ==

The {{{doconce}}} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a {{{.do.txt}}} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:

{{{
Usage: doconce command [optional arguments]
commands: format insertdocstr old2new_format gwiki_figsubst remove_inline_comments latin2html sphinx_dir subst replace replace_from_file clean help latex_header latex_footer guess_encoding change_encoding bbl2rst split_rst list_labels teamod sphinxfix_localURLs make_figure_code_links grab spellcheck ptex2tex expand_commands

doconce assemble name master.do.txt
}}}


== Exercises ==

Doconce supports //Exercise//, //Problem//, and //Project//. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain //elements//:


  * a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or    "Project:", followed by a title (required)
  * a label (optional)
  * a solution file (optional)
  * name of file with a student solution (optional)
  * main exercise text (required)
  * a short answer (optional)
  * a full solution (optional)
  * one or more hints (optional)
  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:
{{{
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
}}}
An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:
{{{
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
}}}
By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.


== Labels, Index, and Citations ==


== Preprocessing ==

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either {{{preprocess}}} and/or
{{{mako}}}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The {{{mako}}} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command {{{doconce format}}} first runs {{{preprocess}}} and then {{{mako}}}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing {{{preprocess}}} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:

{{{
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
}}}

With the {{{mako}}} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [[http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/|example document]] contains
some illustrations on how to utilize {{{mako}}} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the {{{doc/src/make.sh}}} script).

**WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!**

Supported Formats

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 - LaTeX (format 'latex' and 'pdflatex')
 - HTML (format 'html')
 - reStructuredText (format 'rst')
 - plain (untagged) ASCII (format 'plain')
 - Sphinx (format 'sphinx')
 - (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format 'pandoc')
 - Googlecode wiki (format 'gwiki')
 - MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format 'mwiki')
 - Creoloe wiki (format 'cwiki')
 - Epydoc (format 'epydoc')
 - StructuredText (format 'st')

The best supported formats are 'latex', 'sphinx', 'html', and 'plain'.

Title, Authors, and Date

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from 'today' if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., 'Feb 22, 2016'.

The table of contents is removed by writing 'TOC: off'.

Section Types

====================================  ====================================  
            Section type                             Syntax

abstract                              '__Abstract.__' Running text...       
====================================  ====================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with '__Abstract.__' at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more '=' signs of the
next heading.

Inline Formatting

Words surrounded by '*' are emphasized: '*emphasized words*' becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: '_boldface_' become **boldface**.

Lists

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with '*', *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with 'o' and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with '-' followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 - item1
 - item2
  - subitem1 of item2
  - subitem2 of item2

 - item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1
2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
 1. subitem1 of item2
 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: --  
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 keyword2: --  
   followed by text on the next line
 keyword3: --  
   and its description may fit on one line

Comments

Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats 'rst' and
'sphinx' are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes '##' or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives '%<doc>' (beginning) and '<%doc/>' (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where 'name' is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and 'running text' is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

Verbatim/Computer Code

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with 'words in verbatim style'.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between '!bc xxx' and '!ec' directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification 'xxx' indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for 'xxx' are
nothing, 'cod' for a code snippet, 'pro' for a complete program,
'sys' for a terminal session, 'dat' for a data file (or output from a
program),
'Xpro' or 'Xcod' for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming 'X', where 'X' may be 'py' for Python,
'cy' for Cython, 'sh' for Bash or other Unix shells,
'f' for Fortran, 'c' for C, 'cpp' for C++, 'm' for MATLAB,
'pl' for Perl. For output in 'latex' one can let 'xxx' reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the 'ptex2tex' configuration file
('.ptex2tex.cfg'). For 'sphinx' output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments ('xxx') onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what 'sphinx' applies to typeset computer code).

The 'xxx' specifier has only effect for 'latex' and
'sphinx' output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst

The '@@@CODE' identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file 'doconce_program.sh'.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* 'doconce clean' up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* '^doconce split_rst'.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside '!bc shpro'
and '!ec' directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become '!bc shcod' and '!ec' when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension '.X', the environment
becomes '!bc Xpro' or '!bc Xcod' for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments ('Xcod' and 'Xpro') are only active
for 'latex' and 'sphinx' outout.

Important warnings:

 - A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 - Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats 'sphinx', 'latex', and 'pdflatex'
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than 'sphinx',
'latex', and 'pdflatex', inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
'!bt'
and
'!et' ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example::


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
        \nabla\times u & 0.
        \end{align*}
        


will appear as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
        \nabla\times u & 0.
        \end{align*}


One can use '#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")' to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or ('#else') a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the 'sphinx', 'pandoc',
or 'html' formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in 'latex' and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:

  - Use only the equation environments '\[', '\]',
    'equation', 'equation*', 'align', and 'align*'.
  - Labels in multiple equation environments such as 'align' are
    not (yet) handled by 'sphinx' and 'pandoc', so avoid inserting
    labels and referring  to equation labels in 'align' environments.
    Actually, 'align*' is the preferred environment for multiple equations.
  - LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
    Allowing other output formats, such as 'sphinx', makes it necessary
    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
    the format (typically '# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")') to
    include special code for 'latex' and 'pdflatex' output and more
    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
    PDF document.

*LaTeX Newcommands.* Text missing...

Figures and Movies

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
'convert' and 'montage' programs from the ImageMagick suite::


        montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
        montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
        montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png
        
        convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png

Use '+append' for stacking left to right, '-append' for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by '-gravity'.

Tables

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 - Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 - If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 - Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

Labels, References, Citations, and Index

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose 'name'
as some hierarchical name, say 'a:b:c', where 'a' and 'b' indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
'c' is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label 'name' is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before 'ref'.

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where 'name' is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have 'name' on the form
'Author1_Author2_YYYY', 'Author_YYYY', or 'Author1_etal_YYYY', where
'YYYY' is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line 'BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py', where 'name' is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
'name.do.txt'), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the 'BIBFILE' keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the 'latex', 'rst', and
'sphinx' formats.

Capabilities of the "doconce" Program

The 'doconce' program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a '.do.txt' file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::


        Usage: doconce command [optional arguments]
        commands: format insertdocstr old2new_format gwiki_figsubst remove_inline_comments latin2html sphinx_dir subst replace replace_from_file clean help latex_header latex_footer guess_encoding change_encoding bbl2rst split_rst list_labels teamod sphinxfix_localURLs make_figure_code_links grab spellcheck ptex2tex expand_commands

Exercises

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, and *Project*. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain *elements*:

  - a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or
    "Project:", followed by a title (required)
  - a label (optional)
  - a solution file (optional)
  - name of file with a student solution (optional)
  - main exercise text (required)
  - a short answer (optional)
  - a full solution (optional)
  - one or more hints (optional)
  - one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        !esubex

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

Preprocessing

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either 'preprocess' and/or
'mako'. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The 'mako' preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command 'doconce format' first runs 'preprocess' and then 'mako'.
Here is a typical example on utilizing 'preprocess' to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the 'mako' preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An "http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/":example document contains
some illustrations on how to utilize 'mako' (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the 'doc/src/make.sh' script).

B{WARNING: This quick reference is very incomplete!}


Supported Formats
-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 - LaTeX (format C{latex} and C{pdflatex})
 - HTML (format C{html})
 - reStructuredText (format C{rst})
 - plain (untagged) ASCII (format C{plain})
 - Sphinx (format C{sphinx})
 - (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format C{pandoc})
 - Googlecode wiki (format C{gwiki})
 - MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format C{mwiki})
 - Creoloe wiki (format C{cwiki})
 - Epydoc (format C{epydoc})
 - StructuredText (format C{st})

The best supported formats are C{latex}, C{sphinx}, C{html}, and C{plain}.

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from C{today} if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., C{Feb 22, 2016}.

The table of contents is removed by writing C{TOC: off}.


Section Types
-------------

====================================  ====================================  
            Section type                             Syntax                 
====================================  ====================================  
chapter                               C{========= Heading ========} (9 C{=})  
section                               C{======= Heading =======}    (7 C{=})  
subsection                            C{===== Heading =====}        (5 C{=})  
subsubsection                         C{=== Heading ===}            (3 C{=})  
paragraph                             C{__Heading.__}               (2 C{_})  
abstract                              C{__Abstract.__} Running text...       
====================================  ====================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with C{__Abstract.__} at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more C{=} signs of the
next heading.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by C{*} are emphasized: C{*emphasized words*} becomes
I{emphasized words}. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: C{_boldface_} become B{boldface}.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: I{bullet lists}, where each item starts
with C{*}, I{enumeration lists}, where each item starts with C{o} and gets
consqutive numbers,
and I{description} lists, where each item starts with C{-} followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 - item1
 - item2
  - subitem1 of item2
  - subitem2 of item2

 - item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1
2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
 1. subitem1 of item2
 2. subitem2 of item2

3. item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comments
--------

Lines starting with C{#} are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats C{rst} and
C{sphinx} are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes C{##} or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives C{%<doc>} (beginning) and C{<%doc/>} (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where C{name} is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and C{running text} is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with C{words in verbatim style}.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between C{!bc xxx} and C{!ec} directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification C{xxx} indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for C{xxx} are
nothing, C{cod} for a code snippet, C{pro} for a complete program,
C{sys} for a terminal session, C{dat} for a data file (or output from a
program),
C{Xpro} or C{Xcod} for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming C{X}, where C{X} may be C{py} for Python,
C{cy} for Cython, C{sh} for Bash or other Unix shells,
C{f} for Fortran, C{c} for C, C{cpp} for C++, C{m} for MATLAB,
C{pl} for Perl. For output in C{latex} one can let C{xxx} reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the C{ptex2tex} configuration file
(C{.ptex2tex.cfg}). For C{sphinx} output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (C{xxx}) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what C{sphinx} applies to typeset computer code).

The C{xxx} specifier has only effect for C{latex} and
C{sphinx} output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst

The C{@@@CODE} identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file C{doconce_program.sh}.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the I{regular
expression} C{doconce clean} up to, but not including the line
matching the I{regular expression} C{^doconce split_rst}.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside C{!bc shpro}
and C{!ec} directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become C{!bc shcod} and C{!ec} when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension C{.X}, the environment
becomes C{!bc Xpro} or C{!bc Xcod} for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (C{Xcod} and C{Xpro}) are only active
for C{latex} and C{sphinx} outout.

Important warnings:

 - A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.
 - Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats C{sphinx}, C{latex}, and C{pdflatex}
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
M{Ax=b}. To help increase readability in other formats than C{sphinx},
C{latex}, and C{pdflatex}, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
C{!bt}
and
C{!et} ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


will appear as::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



One can use C{#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")} to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or (C{#else}) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the C{sphinx}, C{pandoc},
or C{html} formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in C{latex} and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:

  - Use only the equation environments C{\[}, C{\]},
    C{equation}, C{equation*}, C{align}, and C{align*}.
  - Labels in multiple equation environments such as C{align} are
    not (yet) handled by C{sphinx} and C{pandoc}, so avoid inserting
    labels and referring  to equation labels in C{align} environments.
    Actually, C{align*} is the preferred environment for multiple equations.
  - LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
    Allowing other output formats, such as C{sphinx}, makes it necessary
    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
    the format (typically C{# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")}) to
    include special code for C{latex} and C{pdflatex} output and more
    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
    PDF document.

Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
C{convert} and C{montage} programs from the ImageMagick suite::

        montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
        montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png
        
        convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png

Use C{+append} for stacking left to right, C{-append} for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by C{-gravity}.


Tables
------

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 - Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).
 - There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).
 - If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.
 - Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

Labels, References, Citations, and Index
----------------------------------------

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose C{name}
as some hierarchical name, say C{a:b:c}, where C{a} and C{b} indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
C{c} is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label C{name} is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before C{ref}.

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where C{name} is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have C{name} on the form
C{Author1_Author2_YYYY}, C{Author_YYYY}, or C{Author1_etal_YYYY}, where
C{YYYY} is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line C{BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py}, where C{name} is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
C{name.do.txt}), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the C{BIBFILE} keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the C{latex}, C{rst}, and
C{sphinx} formats.

Capabilities of the "doconce" Program
-------------------------------------

The C{doconce} program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a C{.do.txt} file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::


        Usage: doconce command [optional arguments]
        commands: format insertdocstr old2new_format gwiki_figsubst remove_inline_comments latin2html sphinx_dir subst replace replace_from_file clean help latex_header latex_footer guess_encoding change_encoding bbl2rst split_rst list_labels teamod sphinxfix_localURLs make_figure_code_links grab spellcheck ptex2tex expand_commands

        doconce list_labels doconcefile.do.txt | latexfile.tex
        doconce teamod name
        doconce assemble name master.do.txt


Exercises
---------

Doconce supports I{Exercise}, I{Problem}, and I{Project}. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain I{elements}:

  - a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or
    "Project:", followed by a title (required)
  - a label (optional)
  - a solution file (optional)
  - name of file with a student solution (optional)
  - main exercise text (required)
  - a short answer (optional)
  - a full solution (optional)
  - one or more hints (optional)
  - one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        !esubex

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

Labels, Index, and Citations
----------------------------

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either C{preprocess} and/or
C{mako}. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The C{mako} preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command C{doconce format} first runs C{preprocess} and then C{mako}.
Here is a typical example on utilizing C{preprocess} to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



With the C{mako} preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An U{example document<http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/>} contains
some illustrations on how to utilize C{mako} (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the C{doc/src/make.sh} script).

-----------------

Doconce currently translates files to the following formats:

 * LaTeX (format latex and pdflatex)

 * HTML (format html)

 * reStructuredText (format rst)

 * plain (untagged) ASCII (format plain)

 * Sphinx (format sphinx)

 * (Pandoc extended) Markdown (format pandoc)

 * Googlecode wiki (format gwiki)

 * MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format mwiki)

 * Creoloe wiki (format cwiki)

 * Epydoc (format epydoc)

 * StructuredText (format st)

The best supported formats are latex, sphinx, html, and plain.

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: today
        TOC: on

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is::


        name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from today if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., Feb 22, 2016.

The table of contents is removed by writing TOC: off.


Section Types
-------------

====================================  ====================================  
            Section type                             Syntax

abstract                              __Abstract.__ Running text...       
====================================  ====================================  

Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with __Abstract.__ at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more = signs of the
next heading.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by * are emphasized: *emphasized words* becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: _boldface_ become _boldface_.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with *, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with o and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with - followed
by a keyword and a colon::


        Here is a bullet list:
        
         * item1
         * item2
          * subitem1 of item2
          * subitem2 of item2
         * item3
        
        Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
        Here is an enumeration list:
        
         o item1
         o item2
           may appear on
           multiple lines
          o subitem1 of item2
          o subitem2 of item2
         o item3
        
        And finally a description list:
        
         - keyword1: followed by
           some text
           over multiple
           lines
         - keyword2:
           followed by text on the next line
         - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1: 
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2: 
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3: 
   and its description may fit on one line

Comments
--------

Lines starting with # are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats rst and
sphinx are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes ## or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives %<doc> (beginning) and <%doc/> (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax::


        [name: running text]

where name is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and running text is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running::


        doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments

removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired::


        doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt

This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in::


        Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

resulting in Some sentence with words in verbatim style.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between !bc xxx and !ec directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification xxx indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for xxx are
nothing, cod for a code snippet, pro for a complete program,
sys for a terminal session, dat for a data file (or output from a
program),
Xpro or Xcod for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming X, where X may be py for Python,
cy for Cython, sh for Bash or other Unix shells,
f for Fortran, c for C, cpp for C++, m for MATLAB,
pl for Perl. For output in latex one can let xxx reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the ptex2tex configuration file
(.ptex2tex.cfg). For sphinx output one can insert a comment::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console

that maps environments (xxx) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what sphinx applies to typeset computer code).

The xxx specifier has only effect for latex and
sphinx output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Computer code can also be copied from a file::


         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
         @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst

The @@@CODE identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file doconce_program.sh.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* doconce clean up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* ^doconce split_rst.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside !bc shpro
and !ec directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become !bc shcod and !ec when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension .X, the environment
becomes !bc Xpro or !bc Xcod for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (Xcod and Xpro) are only active
for latex and sphinx outout.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats sphinx, latex, and pdflatex
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
Ax=b. To help increase readability in other formats than sphinx,
latex, and pdflatex, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like::


        $\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
  !bt
and
  !et ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example::


        !bt
        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
        \nabla\times u & 0.
        \end{align*}
        


will appear as::

        \begin{align*}
        \nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
        \nabla\times u & 0.
        \end{align*}


One can use #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki") to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or (#else) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the sphinx, pandoc,
or html formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in latex and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:

  * Use only the equation environments \[, \],
    equation, equation*, align, and align*.

  * Labels in multiple equation environments such as align are
    not (yet) handled by sphinx and pandoc, so avoid inserting
    labels and referring  to equation labels in align environments.
    Actually, align* is the preferred environment for multiple equations.

  * LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
    Allowing other output formats, such as sphinx, makes it necessary
    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
    the format (typically # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")) to
    include special code for latex and pdflatex output and more
    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
    PDF document.

*LaTeX Newcommands.* Text missing...


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax::


        FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        
        MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. label{some:fig:label}
        

Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
convert and montage programs from the ImageMagick suite::


        montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
        montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
        montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png
        
        convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png

Use +append for stacking left to right, -append for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by -gravity.


Tables
------

The table in the section "Section Types" was written with this
syntax::


        |----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
        |      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
        |----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
        | chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
        | section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
        | subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |
        | subsubsection           | `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  |
        | paragraph               | `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  |
        |-----------------------------------------------------------------|


Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

Labels, References, Citations, and Index
----------------------------------------

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax::


        label{name}

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose name
as some hierarchical name, say a:b:c, where a and b indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
c is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label name is written as::


        ref{name}

again with no backslash before ref.

Single citations are written as::


        cite{name}

where name is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have name on the form
Author1_Author2_YYYY, Author_YYYY, or Author1_etal_YYYY, where
YYYY is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma::


        cite{name1,name2,name3}


The bibliography is specified by a line BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py, where name is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
name.do.txt), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the BIBFILE keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)::


        index{name}

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the latex, rst, and
sphinx formats.

Capabilities of the "doconce" Program
-------------------------------------

The doconce program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a .do.txt file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities::

Exercises
---------

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, and *Project*. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or
    "Project:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows::


        ===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
        label{problem:ellipsearea1}
        file=ellipse_area.pdf
        solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf
        
        Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
        the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
        Show each step in the mathematical derivation.
        
        !bhint
        Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        "Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
        compute the integral.
        !ehint

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up::


        ===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
        label{exer:moondist}
        
        Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.
        
        !bsubex
        Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.
        
        file=subexer_a.pdf
        
        !bans
        Short answer to subexercise a).
        !eans
        
        !bhint
        First hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        
        !bhint
        Second hint to subexercise a).
        !ehint
        !esubex
        
        !bsubex
        Here goes the text for subexercise b).
        
        file=subexer_b.pdf
        
        !bhint
        A hint for this subexercise.
        !ehint
        !esubex

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either preprocess and/or
mako. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The mako preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command doconce format first runs preprocess and then mako.
Here is a typical example on utilizing preprocess to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions::


        # #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"
        
        # #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        \begin{table}
        \caption{Some words... label{mytab}}
        \begin{tabular}{lrr}
        \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        \multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
        \hline
        0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
        2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
        4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
        \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
        # #else
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        # #endif
        
        # #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
        ....large portions of text...
        # #endif


With the mako preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An example document (http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/) contains
some illustrations on how to utilize mako (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the doc/src/make.sh script).

 * Googlecode wiki (format `gwiki`)

 * MediaWiki for Wikipedia and Wikibooks (format `mwiki`)

 * Creoloe wiki (format `cwiki`)

 * Epydoc (format `epydoc`)

 * StructuredText (format `st`)

The best supported formats are `latex`, `sphinx`, `html`, and `plain`.

Title, Authors, and Date
------------------------

A typical example of giving a title, a set of authors, a date,
and an optional table of contents
reads

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump Email: dump@cyb.space.com at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: today
TOC: on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entire title must appear on a single line.
The author syntax is

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
name Email: somename@adr.net at institution1 and institution2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where the email is optional, the "at" keyword is required if one or
more institutions are to be specified, and the "and" keyword
separates the institutions. Each author specification must appear
on a single line.
When more than one author belong to the
same institution, make sure that the institution is specified in an identical
way for each author.

The date can be set as any text different from `today` if not the
current date is wanted, e.g., `Feb 22, 2016`.

The table of contents is removed by writing `TOC: off`.


Section Types
-------------


            Section type                             Syntax                 
------------------------------------  ------------------------------------  
chapter                               `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  
section                               `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  
subsection                            `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  
subsubsection                         `=== Heading ===`            (3 `=`)  
paragraph                             `__Heading.__`               (2 `_`)  
abstract                              `__Abstract.__` Running text...       


Note that abstracts are recognized by starting with `__Abstract.__` at
the beginning of a line and ending with three or more `=` signs of the
next heading.

Inline Formatting
-----------------

Words surrounded by `*` are emphasized: `*emphasized words*` becomes
*emphasized words*. Similarly, an underscore surrounds words that
appear in boldface: `_boldface_` become _boldface_.

Lists
-----

There are three types of lists: *bullet lists*, where each item starts
with `*`, *enumeration lists*, where each item starts with `o` and gets
consqutive numbers,
and *description* lists, where each item starts with `-` followed
by a keyword and a colon.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is a bullet list:

 * item1
 * item2
  * subitem1 of item2
  * subitem2 of item2
 * item3

Note that sublists are consistently indented by one or more blanks..
Here is an enumeration list:

 o item1
 o item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines
  o subitem1 of item2
  o subitem2 of item2
 o item3

And finally a description list:

 - keyword1: followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines
 - keyword2:
   followed by text on the next line
 - keyword3: and its description may fit on one line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code above follows.

Here is a bullet list:

 * item1

 * item2

  * subitem1 of item2

  * subitem2 of item2


 * item3

Note that sublists are indented.
Here is an enumeration list:

1. item1

2. item2
   may appear on
   multiple lines

 1. subitem1 of item2

 2. subitem2 of item2


3. item3

And finally a description list:

 keyword1:
  :    
   followed by
   some text
   over multiple
   lines

 keyword2:
  :    
   followed by text on the next line

 keyword3:
  :    
   and its description may fit on one line

Comments
--------

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments in the document and
translated to the proper syntax for comments in the output
document. Such comment lines should not appear before LaTeX math
blocks, verbatim code blocks, or lists if the formats `rst` and
`sphinx` are desired.

When using the Mako preprocessor one can also place comments in
the Doconce source file that will be removed by Mako before
Doconce starts processing the file. Mako comments are recognized
by lines starting with two hashes `##` or by blocks of text
inside the comment directives `%<doc>` (beginning) and `<%doc/>` (end).

Inline comments, in the text, that are meant as messages or notes to readers
(authors in particular)
are often useful and enabled by the syntax

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[name: running text]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where `name` is the name or ID of an author or reader making the comment,
and `running text` is the comment. There must be a space after the colon.
Running

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
doconce format html mydoc.do.txt --skip_inline_comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

removes all such inline comments from the output. This feature makes it easy
to turn on and off notes to readers and is frequently used while writing
a document.

All inline comments to readers can also be physically
removed from the Doconce source if desired:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This action is appropriate when all issues with such comments are resolved.

Verbatim/Computer Code
----------------------

Inline verbatim code is typeset within back-ticks, as in

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

resulting in Some sentence with `words in verbatim style`.

Multi-line blocks of verbatim text, typically computer code, is typeset
in between `!bc xxx` and `!ec` directives (which must appear on the
beginning of the line). A specification `xxx` indicates what verbatim
formatting style that is to be used. Typical values for `xxx` are
nothing, `cod` for a code snippet, `pro` for a complete program,
`sys` for a terminal session, `dat` for a data file (or output from a
program),
`Xpro` or `Xcod` for a program or code snipped, respectively,
in programming `X`, where `X` may be `py` for Python,
`cy` for Cython, `sh` for Bash or other Unix shells,
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, `m` for MATLAB,
`pl` for Perl. For output in `latex` one can let `xxx` reflect any
defined verbatim environment in the `ptex2tex` configuration file
(`.ptex2tex.cfg`). For `sphinx` output one can insert a comment

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

that maps environments (`xxx`) onto valid language types for
Pygments (which is what `sphinx` applies to typeset computer code).

The `xxx` specifier has only effect for `latex` and
`sphinx` output. All other formats use a fixed monospace font for all
kinds of verbatim output.

Computer code can also be copied from a file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  fromto: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
 @@@CODE doconce_program.sh  from-to: doconce clean@^doconce split_rst
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `@@@CODE` identifier must appear at the very beginning of the line.
The first specification copies the complete file `doconce_program.sh`.
The second specification copies from the first line matching the *regular
expression* `doconce clean` up to, but not including the line
matching the *regular expression* `^doconce split_rst`.
The third specification behaves as the second, but the line matching
the first regular expression is not copied (aimed at copying
text between begin-end comment pair in the file).

The copied line from file are in this example put inside `!bc shpro`
and `!ec` directives, if a complete file is copied, while the
directives become `!bc shcod` and `!ec` when a code snippet is copied
from file. In general, for a filename extension `.X`, the environment
becomes `!bc Xpro` or `!bc Xcod` for a complete program or snippet,
respectively. The enivorments (`Xcod` and `Xpro`) are only active
for `latex` and `sphinx` outout.

Important warnings:

 * A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
   output in reStructredText), not directly after a section/paragraph heading,
   table, comment, figure, or movie.

 * Verbatim code blocks inside lists can be ugly typeset in some
   output formats. A more robust approach is to replace the list by
   paragraphs with headings.

LaTeX Mathematics
-----------------

Doconce supports inline mathematics and blocks of mathematics, using
standard LaTeX syntax. The output formats `sphinx`, `latex`, and `pdflatex`
work with this syntax while all other formats will just display the
raw LaTeX code.

Inline expressions are written in the standard
LaTeX way with the mathematics surrounded by dollar signs, as in
$Ax=b$. To help increase readability in other formats than `sphinx`,
`latex`, and `pdflatex`, inline mathematics may have a more human
readable companion expression. The syntax is like

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$\sin(\norm{\bf u})$|$sin(||u||)$
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That is, the LaTeX expression appears to the left of a vertical bar (pipe
symbol) and the more readable expression appears to the right. Both
expressions are surrounded by dollar signs. Plain text formats and HTML
will applied the expression to the right.

Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are written within
`!bt`
and
`!et` ("begin/end TeX") directives.
For example,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
$$
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

will appear as
$$
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot u &= 0,\\
\nabla\times u & 0.
\end{align*}
$$

One can use `#if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx", "mwiki")` to let
the preprocessor choose a block of mathematics in LaTeX format
or (`#else`) a modified form more suited for plain text and wiki
formats without support for mathematics.

Any LaTeX syntax is accepted, but if output in the `sphinx`, `pandoc`,
or `html` formats
is important, one must know that these formats does not support many
LaTeX constructs. For output both in `latex` and the mentioned formats
the following rules are recommended:

  * Use only the equation environments `\[`, `\]`,
    `equation`, `equation*`, `align`, and `align*`.

  * Labels in multiple equation environments such as `align` are
    not (yet) handled by `sphinx` and `pandoc`, so avoid inserting
    labels and referring  to equation labels in `align` environments.
    Actually, `align*` is the preferred environment for multiple equations.

  * LaTeX supports lots of fancy formatting, for example, multiple
    plots in the same figure, footnotes, margin notes, etc.
    Allowing other output formats, such as `sphinx`, makes it necessary
    to only utilze very standard LaTeX and avoid, for instance, more than
    one plot per figure. However, one can use preprocessor if-tests on
    the format (typically `# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")`) to
    include special code for `latex` and `pdflatex` output and more
    straightforward typesetting for other formats. In this way, one can
    also allow advanced LaTeX features and fine tuning of resulting
    PDF document.

*LaTeX Newcommands.* Text missing...


Figures and Movies
------------------

Figures and movies have almost equal syntax:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIGURE: [relative/path/to/figurefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. \label{some:fig:label}

MOVIE: [relative/path/to/moviefile, width=500] Here goes the caption which must be on a single line. \label{some:fig:label}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note the mandatory comma after the figure/movie file.

The figure file can be listed without extension. Doconce will then find
the version of the file with the most appropriate extension for the chosen
output format. If not suitable version is found, Doconce will convert
another format to the desired one.

Movie files can either be a video or a wildcard expression for a
series of frames. In the latter case, a simple device in an HTML page
will display the individual frame files as a movie.

Combining several image files into one can be done by the
`convert` and `montage` programs from the ImageMagick suite:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.Bash}
montage file1.png file2.png ... file4.png -geometry +2+2  result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile x1 result.png
montage file1.png file2.png -tile 1x result.png

convert -background white file1.png file2.png +append tmp.png
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use `+append` for stacking left to right, `-append` for top to bottom.
The positioning of the figures can be controlled by `-gravity`.


Tables
------

The table in the section [Section Types](#s) was written with this
syntax:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
|----------------c--------|------------------c--------------------|
|      Section type       |        Syntax                         |
|----------------l--------|------------------l--------------------|
| chapter                 | `========= Heading ========` (9 `=`)  |
| section                 | `======= Heading =======`    (7 `=`)  |
| subsection              | `===== Heading =====`        (5 `=`)  |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that

 * Each line begins and ends with a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * Column data are separated by a vertical bar (pipe symbol).

 * There may be horizontal rules, i.e., lines with dashes for
   indicating the heading and the end of the table, and these may
   contain characters 'c', 'l', or 'r' for how to align headings or
   columns. The first horizontal rule may indicate how to align
   headings (center, left, right), and the horizontal rule after the
   heading line may indicate how to align the data in the columns
   (center, left, right).

 * If the horizontal rules are without alignment information there should
   be no vertical bar (pipe symbol) between the columns. Otherwise, such
   a bar indicates a vertical bar between columns in LaTeX.

 * Many output formats are so primitive that heading and column alignment
   have no effect.

Labels, References, Citations, and Index
----------------------------------------

The notion of labels, references, citations, and an index is adopted
from LaTeX with a very similar syntax. As in LaTeX, a label can be
inserted anywhere, using the syntax

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\label{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

with no backslash
preceding the label keyword! It is common practice to choose `name`
as some hierarchical name, say `a:b:c`, where `a` and `b` indicate
some abbreviations for a section and/or subsection for the topic and
`c` is some name for the particular unit that has a label.

A reference to the label `name` is written as

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ref{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

again with no backslash before `ref`.

Single citations are written as

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cite{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

where `name` is a logical name
of the reference (again, LaTeX writers must not insert a backslash).
Bibliography citations often have `name` on the form
`Author1_Author2_YYYY`, `Author_YYYY`, or `Author1_etal_YYYY`, where
`YYYY` is the year of the publication.
Multiple citations at once is possible by separating the logical names
by comma:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cite{name1,name2,name3}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bibliography is specified by a line `BIBFILE: name_bib.bib,
name_bib.rst, name_bib.py`, where `name` is the logical name of the
document (the doconce file will then normally have the name
`name.do.txt`), and the various files reflect different formattings of
the bibliography: '.bib' indicates a BibTeX file, '.rst' a reST-style
bibliography, and '.py' a Python list of dictionaries for specifying
the entries in the bibliography. The bibliography (as read from file)
is inserted where the `BIBFILE` keyword appears.

Doconce supports creating an index of keywords. A certain keyword
is registered for the index by a syntax like (no
backslash!)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
index{name}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to place any index of this type outside
running text, i.e., after (sub)section titles and in the space between
paragraphs. Index specifications placed right before paragraphs also
gives the doconce source code an indication of the content in the
forthcoming text. The index is only produced for the `latex`, `rst`, and
`sphinx` formats.

Capabilities of the "doconce" Program
-------------------------------------

The `doconce` program can be used for a number of purposes besides
transforming a `.do.txt` file to some format. Here is the
list of capabilities:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Usage: doconce command [optional arguments]
commands: format insertdocstr old2new_format gwiki_figsubst remove_inline_comments latin2html sphinx_dir subst replace replace_from_file clean help latex_header latex_footer guess_encoding change_encoding bbl2rst split_rst list_labels teamod sphinxfix_localURLs make_figure_code_links grab spellcheck ptex2tex expand_commands

doconce format html|latex|pdflatex|rst|sphinx|plain|gwiki|mwiki|cwiki|pandoc|st|epytext file.do.txt

doconce subst [-s -m -x --restore] regex-pattern regex-replacement file1 file2 ...
(-s is the re.DOTALL modifier, -m is the re.MULTILINE modifier,
 -x is the re.VERBOSE modifier, --restore copies backup files back again)

doconce replace from-text to-text file1 file2 ...
(exact text substutition)

doconce replace_from_file file-with-from-to file1 file2 ...
(exact text substitution, but a set of from-to relations)

doconce gwiki_figsubst file.gwiki URL-of-fig-dir

doconce remove_inline_comments file.do.txt

doconce sphinx_dir author='Me and you' title='Quick title' \
    version=0.1 dirname=sphinx-rootdir theme=default \
    file1 file2 file3
(requires sphinx version >= 1.1)

doconce latin2html file.html

doconce insertdocstr rootdir

doconce clean
(remove all files that the doconce format can regenerate)

doconce latex_header
doconce latex_footer

doconce change_encoding utf-8 latin1 filename

doconce expand_commands file1 file2 ...
doconce list_labels doconcefile.do.txt | latexfile.tex
doconce teamod name
doconce assemble name master.do.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exercises
---------

Doconce supports *Exercise*, *Problem*, and *Project*. These are typeset
as ordinary sections and referred to by their section labels.
An exercise, problem, or project sections contains certain *elements*:

  * a headline at the level of a subsection or subsubsection,
    containing one of the words "Exercise:", "Problem:", or
    "Project:", followed by a title (required)

  * a label (optional)

  * a solution file (optional)

  * name of file with a student solution (optional)

  * main exercise text (required)

  * a short answer (optional)

  * a full solution (optional)

  * one or more hints (optional)

  * one or more subexercises (subproblems, subprojects), which can also
    contain a text, a short answer, a full solution, name student file
    to be handed in, and one or more hints (optional)

A typical sketch of a a problem without subexercises goes as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== Problem: Derive the Formula for the Area of an Ellipse =====
\label{problem:ellipsearea1}
file=ellipse_area.pdf
solution=ellipse_area1_sol.pdf

Derive an expression for the area of an ellipse by integrating
the area under a curve that defines half of the allipse.
Show each step in the mathematical derivation.

!bhint
Wikipedia has the formula for the curve.
!ehint

!bhint
"Wolframalpha": "http://wolframalpha.com" can perhaps
compute the integral.
!ehint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An exercise with subproblems, answers and full solutions has this
setup-up:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
\label{exer:moondist}

Intro to this exercise. Questions are in subexercises below.

!bsubex
Subexercises are numbered a), b), etc.

file=subexer_a.pdf

!bans
Short answer to subexercise a).
!eans

!bhint
First hint to subexercise a).
!ehint

!bhint
Second hint to subexercise a).
!ehint
!esubex

!bsubex
Here goes the text for subexercise b).

file=subexer_b.pdf

!bhint
A hint for this subexercise.
!ehint
!esubex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, answers, solutions, and hints are typeset as paragraphs.

Labels, Index, and Citations
----------------------------

Preprocessing
-------------

Doconce documents may utilize a preprocessor, either `preprocess` and/or
`mako`. The former is a C-style preprocessor that allows if-tests
and including other files (but not macros with arguments).
The `mako` preprocessor is much more advanced - it is actually a full
programming language, very similar to Python.

The command `doconce format` first runs `preprocess` and then `mako`.
Here is a typical example on utilizing `preprocess` to include another
document, "comment out" a large portion of text, and to write format-specific
constructions:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# #include "myotherdoc.do.txt"

# #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
\begin{table}
\caption{Some words... \label{mytab}}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{time} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{velocity} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{acceleration} \\
\hline
0.0          & 1.4186       & -5.01        \\
2.0          & 1.376512     & 11.919       \\
4.0          & 1.1E+1       & 14.717624    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
# #else
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
# #endif

# #ifdef EXTRA_MATERIAL
....large portions of text...
# #endif
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the `mako` preprocessor the if-else tests have slightly different syntax.
An [example document](http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/) contains
some illustrations on how to utilize `mako` (clone the GitHub project and
examine the Doconce source and the `doc/src/make.sh` script).

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.1.3 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.1.3 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [0.6]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.1.3 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [0.7]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/conf.py.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/Makefile.
Creating file sphinx-rootdir/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
