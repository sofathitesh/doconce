===== Table Demo =====
label{subsec:table}

Let us take this table from the manual:
idx{some `class X` which is convenient}

% if FORMAT == "latex":
\begin{table}
\caption{
Table of velocity and acceleration.
label{mytab}
}
% endif

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

% if FORMAT == "latex":
\end{table}
% endif

The Doconce source code reads
!bc cod
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
!ec

Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--l-------l----------l----------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 1.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 3.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

===== URLs ======
label{subsubsec:ex}

Here are some nice URLs, e.g., hpl's home page "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl",
or the URL if desired, "URL": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
Here is a plain file link "URL": "testdoc.do.txt", or "url":"testdoc.do.txt",
or URL: "testdoc.do.txt" or url : "testdoc.do.txt" or "a link
with newline": "testdoc.do.txt". Can test spaces
with the link with word too: "hpl": "http://folk.uio.no/hpl" or
"hpl" : "http://folk.uio.no/hpl". The old syntax must also be
tested: http://folk.uio.no/hpl<hpl's homepage>. Now also `file:///`
works: "link to a file":"file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html"
is fine to have.

# Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because of reST):
# note that when there is no http: or file:, it can be a file link
# if the link name is URL, url, "URL", or "url".

% if FORMAT == "latex":

===== Some LaTeX Constructs =====

Let's check abbr. of some common kind, e.g. the well-known i.e.
7-9 as an example. Moreover, Dr. Tang and Prof. Monsen,
or maybe also prof. Ting,
will go to the Dept. of Science to test how Mr. Hansen is doing together
with Ms. Larsen. A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e. since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig. 4 to see how the data compares with Tab. ref{mytab}.
% endif

Here is an equation without label:
!bt
\[ a = b + c \]
!et
or with number and label, as in (ref{my:eq1}):
!bt
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u\label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
!et
We can refer to this equation by (ref{my:eq1}).
Or a system of equations with labels,
!bt
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\label{eq1} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
!et
We can refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}).
Or align without eq numbers:
!bt
\begin{align*}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x
\end{align*}
!et

Or with multline?
!bt
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
!et
Maybe split is better:
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
!et
And we can refer to the last equation by (ref{split:envir:eq}).

What about gather?
!bt
\begin{gather}
a = b \\
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}
!et

And what about alignat?
!bt
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0\label{eq1a} \\
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
!et
Let us refer to (ref{eq1})-(ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (ref{eq1a})-(ref{eq2a}), and to (ref{my:eq1}).

Here is eqnarray:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f,label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{eqnarray}
!et


======= Exercises =======

===== Problem: Flip a Coin =====
label{demo:ex:1} file=`flip_coin.py`

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


__Hint 1.__ Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.

__Hint 2.__ Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
`r = random.randint(1,2)` and define head when `r` is 1.


===== Exercise: Compute a Probability =====
label{demo:ex:2} file=`compute_prob.py`  solution=

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard `random` module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$. Run the program with the four
values $N=10^i$ for $i=1,2,3,6$.

Here are some nice URLs, e.g., hpl's home page \href{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}{hpl},
or the URL if desired, \href{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}{\nolinkurl{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}}.
Here is a plain file link \href{testdoc.do.txt}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}}, or \href{testdoc.do.txt}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}},
or \href{testdoc.do.txt}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{testdoc.do.txt}{\nolinkurl{testdoc.do.txt}} or \href{testdoc.do.txt}{a link
with newline}. Can test spaces
with the link with word too: \href{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}{hpl} or
\href{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}{hpl}. The old syntax must also be
tested: \href{http://folk.uio.no/hpl}{hpl's homepage}. Now also \code{file:///}
works: \href{file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html}{link to a file}
is fine to have.

% Comments should be inserted outside paragraphs (because of reST):

\subsection{Some {\LaTeX} Constructs}
Let's check abbr.~of some common kind, e.g.~the well-known i.e.
7-9 as an example. Moreover, Dr.~Tang and Prof.~Monsen,
or maybe also prof.~Ting,
will go to the Dept.~of Science to test how Mr.~Hansen is doing together
with Ms.~Larsen. A sentence containing "refines lines" could easily
fool a regex substitution with only i.e.~since the dot matches anything.
Also, look at Fig.~4 to see how the data compares with Tab.~\ref{mytab}.

Here is an equation without label:
\[ a = b + c \]
or with number and label, as in (\ref{my:eq1}):
\begin{equation}
{\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u\label{my:eq1}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation by (\ref{my:eq1}).
Or a system of equations with labels,
\begin{align}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\label{eq1} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
\end{align}
We can refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}).
Or align without eq numbers:
\begin{align*}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x
\end{align*}

Or with multline?
\begin{multline}
a = b = q + \\ 
  f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\label{multiline:eq1}
\end{multline}
Maybe split is better:
\begin{equation}
\label{split:envir:eq}
\begin{split}
a = b = q &+ \\ 
  & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
\end{split}
\end{equation}
And we can refer to the last equation by (\ref{split:envir:eq}).

What about gather?
\begin{gather}
a = b \\ 
c = d + 7 + 9
\end{gather}

And what about alignat?
\begin{alignat}{2}
a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0\label{eq1a} \\ 
b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
\end{alignat}
Let us refer to (\ref{eq1})-(\ref{eq2}) again, and to the
alignat variant (\ref{eq1a})-(\ref{eq2a}), and to (\ref{my:eq1}).

Here is eqnarray:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f,\label{myeq1}\\ 
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{eqnarray}


\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Problem: Flip a Coin}
\label{demo:ex:1} file=`flip_coin.py`

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


\paragraph{Hint 1.}
Use \code{r = random.random()} and define head as \code{r <= 0.5}.

\paragraph{Hint 2.}
Draw an integer among $\{1,2\}$ with
\code{r = random.randint(1,2)} and define head when \code{r} is 1.

\subsection{Exercise: Compute a Probability}
\label{demo:ex:2} file=`compute_prob.py`  solution=

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval $[0,1)$?
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw $N$ such random numbers using Python's standard \code{random} module,
count how many of them, $M$, that fall in the interval $(0.5,0.6)$, and
compute the probability as $M/N$. Run the program with the four
values $N=10^i$ for $i=1,2,3,6$.

is fine to have.

Here is an equation without label:

.. math::
         a = b + c 

or with number and label, as in :eq:`my:eq1`:

.. math::
   :label: my:eq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u
        

We can refer to this equation by :eq:`my:eq1`.
Or a system of equations with labels,

.. math::
        
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
        

We can refer to (:ref:`eq1`)-(:ref:`eq2`).
Or align without eq numbers:

.. math::
        
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x
        


Or with multline?

.. math::
   :label: multiline:eq1
        
        a = b = q + \\ 
          f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

Maybe split is better:

.. math::
   :label: split:envir:eq
        
        
        
        a = b = q &+ \\ 
          & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        
        

And we can refer to the last equation by :eq:`split:envir:eq`.

What about gather?

.. math::
        
        a = b \\ 
        c = d + 7 + 9
        


And what about alignat?

.. math::
        \begin{alignat}{2}
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0 \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega 
        \end{alignat}

Let us refer to (:ref:`eq1`)-(:ref:`eq2`) again, and to the
alignat variant (:ref:`eq1a`)-(:ref:`eq2a`), and to :eq:`my:eq1`.

Here is eqnarray:

.. math::
   :label: myeq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla^2 u + f,\\

Problem: Flip a Coin
--------------------
 file=`flip_coin.py`

Make a program that simulates flipping a coin M{N} times.
Print out "tail" or "head" for each flip and
let the program count the number of heads.


I{Hint 1.} Use C{r = random.random()} and define head as C{r <= 0.5}.

I{Hint 2.} Draw an integer among M{\{1,2\}} with
C{r = random.randint(1,2)} and define head when C{r} is 1.


Exercise: Compute a Probability
-------------------------------
 file=`compute_prob.py`  solution=

What is the probability of getting a number between 0.5 and 0.6 when
drawing uniformly distributed random numbers from the interval M{[0,1)}?
To answer this question empirically, let a program
draw M{N} such random numbers using Python's standard C{random} module,
count how many of them, M{M}, that fall in the interval M{(0.5,0.6)}, and
compute the probability as M{M/N}. Run the program with the four
values M{N=10^i} for M{i=1,2,3,6}.

Table Demo
----------

Let us take this table from the manual:


============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
0.0                 1.4186         -5.01  
2.0               1.376512        11.919  
4.0                 1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  


The Doconce source code reads::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--l--------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|


Here is yet another table to test that we can handle more than
one table:

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration

3.0           1.1E+1        14.717624

URLs
----

Here are some nice URLs, e.g., hpl's home page hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl),
or the URL if desired, http://folk.uio.no/hpl.
Here is a plain file link testdoc.do.txt, or testdoc.do.txt,
or testdoc.do.txt or testdoc.do.txt or a link
with newline (testdoc.do.txt). Can test spaces
with the link with word too: hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl) or
hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl). The old syntax must also be
tested: hpl's homepage (http://folk.uio.no/hpl). Now also file:///
works: link to a file (file:///home/hpl/vc/doconce/trunk/test/tmp_HTML.html)
is fine to have.



Here is an equation without label::

        \[ a = b + c \]

or with number and label, as in Equation (my:eq1)::

        \begin{equation}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u\label{my:eq1}
        \end{equation}

We can refer to this equation by Equation (my:eq1).
Or a system of equations with labels::

        \begin{align}
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\label{eq1} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x \label{eq2}
        \end{align}

We can refer to Equations (eq1)-(eq2).
Or align without eq numbers::

        \begin{align*}
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6 \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x
        \end{align*}


Or with multline::

        \begin{multline}
        a = b = q + \\ 
          f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        label{multiline:eq1}
        \end{multline}

Maybe split is better::

        \begin{equation}
        label{split:envir:eq}
        \begin{split}
        a = b = q &+ \\ 
          & f + \nabla\cdot\nabla u
        \end{split}
        \end{equation}

And we can refer to the last equation by Equation (split:envir:eq).

What about gather::

        \begin{gather}
        a = b \\ 
        c = d + 7 + 9
        \end{gather}


And what about alignat::

        \begin{alignat}{2}
        a &= q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad & \mbox{for } q\geq 0\label{eq1a} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x & x\in\Omega \label{eq2a}
        \end{alignat}

Let us refer to Equations (eq1)-(eq2) again, and to the
alignat variant Equations (eq1a)-(eq2a), and to Equation (my:eq1).

Here is eqnarray::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f,label{myeq1}\\ 
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{eqnarray}

Doconce is a minimum tagged markup language. The file
<a href="tutorial.do.txt">tutorial.do.txt</a> is the source of the
Doconce tutorial, written in the Doconce format.
Running
<pre>
doconce format html tutorial.do.txt
</pre>
produces the HTML file <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial.html</a>.
Going from Doconce to LaTeX is done by
<pre>
doconce format latex tutorial.do.txt
</pre>
resulting in the file <a href="tutorial.tex">tutorial.tex</a>, which can
be compiled to a PDF file <a href="tutorial.pdf">tutorial.pdf</a>
by running <tt>latex</tt> and <tt>dvipdf</tt> the standard way.
<p>
The reStructuredText (reST) format is of particular interest:
<pre>
doconce format rst    tutorial.do.txt  # standard reST
doconce format sphinx tutorial.do.txt  # Sphinx extension of reST
</pre>
The reST file <a href="tutorial.rst">tutorial.rst</a> is a starting point
for conversion to many other formats: OpenOffice,
<a href="tutorial.xml">XML</a>, <a href="tutorial.rst.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="tutorial.rst.tex">LaTeX</a>,

TITLE: Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Simula Research Laboratory and University of Oslo
DATE: today


 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like "LaTeX":"http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf", "HTML":"http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/", "reStructuredText":"http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html", "Sphinx":"http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html", and "wiki":"http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax"? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


======= The Doconce Concept  =======

Doconce is two things:

  o Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)


  o Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".



Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code,
    say in examples, directly from the source code files.
  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is obviously a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



======= What Does Doconce Look Like? =======

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,

  * bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,

  * *emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks,

  * _words in boldface_ are surrounded by underscores,

  * words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset verbatim (monospace font),

  * section headings are recognied by equality (`=`) signs before
    and after the text, and the number of `=` signs indicates the
    level of the section (7 for main section, 5 for subsection,
    3 for subsubsection),

  * paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading,

  * blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    `!bc` (begin code) and `!ec` (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block,

  * blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files,

  * blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    `!bt` (begin TeX) and `!et` (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block,

  * there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,

  * figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported,

  * comments can be inserted throughout the text (`#` at the beginning
    of a line),

  * with a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text,

  * with the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
!bc
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
!ec
The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an `o`
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

===== Mathematics and Computer Code =====

Inline mathematics, such as $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$ is
typeset as
!bc
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
!ec
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
`!bt` and `!et` (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{eqnarray}
!et
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
`!bc` and `!ec` instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like
!bc cod
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
!ec
It is possible to add a specification of a (ptex2tex-style)
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., `!bc xxx`
where `xxx` is an identifier like `pycod` for code snippet in Python,
`sys` for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ptex2tex and defined in a
configuration file `.ptext2tex.cfg`, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):
!bc
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console
!ec
By default, `pro` and `cod` are `python`, `sys` is `console`,
while `xpro` and `xcod` are computer language specific for `x`
in `f` (Fortran), `c` (C), `cpp` (C++), and `py` (Python).
# `rb` (Ruby), `pl` (Perl), and `sh` (Unix shell).

# (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code
# blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments
# and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the
# first one is used.)

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with `!bc pro`, while a part of a file is copied into a `!bc cod`
environment. What `pro` and `cod` mean is then defined through
a `.ptex2tex.cfg` file for LaTeX and a `sphinx code-blocks`
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing `#include "mynote.do.txt"`
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension `do.txt`. The `do` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing `.txt` denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


===== Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography =====
label{newcommands}

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the `doc/manual/manual.do.txt` file (see the
"demo page": "https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html"
for various formats of this document).


# Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess):

# #include "_doconce2anything.do.txt"


===== Demos =====

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file
!bc
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
!ec
The file `make.sh` in the `tutorial` directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, `tutorial.do.txt` is the
starting point.  Running `make.sh` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original `tutorial.do.txt` file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
"Here": "https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html"
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the `docs/manual` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, `manual.do.txt`, to
various formats. The `make.sh` script runs a set of translations.

===== Dependencies =====

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either "Preprocess": "http://code.google.com/p/preprocess" or "Mako":
"http://www.makotemplates.org" must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need "ptex2tex": "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex" and some style
files that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires "docutils": "http://docutils.sourceforge.net".  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course "Sphinx": "http://sphinx.pocoo.org".
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to "Pandoc": "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/" is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

<UL>
 <LI> When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?
 <LI> Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like <A HREF="http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf">LaTeX</A>, <A HREF="http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/">HTML</A>, <A HREF="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html">reStructuredText</A>, <A HREF="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html">Sphinx</A>, and <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax">wiki</A>? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?
 <LI> Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?
</UL>

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.

<P>

<P>
<H1>The Doconce Concept</H1>
<P>
Doconce is two things:

<P>

<OL>
 <LI> Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)
 <LI> Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".
</OL>

Here are some Doconce features:

<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  <LI> Doconce can be converted to plain <EM>untagged</EM> text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  <LI> Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code,
    say in examples, directly from the source code files.
  <LI> Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  <LI> Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  <LI> Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is obviously a superior tool.
</UL>

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  <LI> Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  <LI> Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.
</UL>

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

<P>
Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.

<P>

<P>

<P>
<H1>What Does Doconce Look Like?</H1>
<P>
Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,

<P>

<UL>
  <LI> bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,
  <LI> <EM>emphasized words</EM> are surrounded by asterisks,
  <LI> <B>words in boldface</B> are surrounded by underscores,
  <LI> words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset verbatim (monospace font),
  <LI> section headings are recognied by equality (<TT>=</TT>) signs before
    and after the text, and the number of <TT>=</TT> signs indicates the
    level of the section (7 for main section, 5 for subsection,
    3 for subsubsection),
  <LI> paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading,
  <LI> blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    <TT>!bc</TT> (begin code) and <TT>!ec</TT> (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block,
  <LI> blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files,
  <LI> blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    <TT>!bt</TT> (begin TeX) and <TT>!et</TT> (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block,
  <LI> there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,
  <LI> figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported,
  <LI> comments can be inserted throughout the text (<TT>#</TT> at the beginning
    of a line),
  <LI> with a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text,
  <LI> with the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.
</UL>

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines

<H3>Mathematics and Computer Code</H3>
<P>
Inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x),
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

<P>
Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
<TT>!bt</TT> and <TT>!et</TT> (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{eqnarray}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

<P>
You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
<TT>!bc</TT> and <TT>!ec</TT> instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   cod-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

Transformation of a Doconce document <TT>mydoc.do.txt</TT> to various other

<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->

</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The <TT>mako</TT> or <TT>preprocess</TT> programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to <TT>mako</TT> or <TT>preprocess</TT> can be added after the
filename. For example,
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The variable <TT>FORMAT</TT> is always defined as the current format when
running <TT>preprocess</TT>. That is, in the last example, <TT>FORMAT</TT> is
defined as <TT>latex</TT>. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like <TT>#if FORMAT == "latex"</TT>.

<P>
Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file <TT>mydoc.do.txt</TT>
is performed by
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->

<H3>LaTeX</H3>
<P>
Making a LaTeX file <TT>mydoc.tex</TT> from <TT>mydoc.do.txt</TT> is done in two steps:
<!-- Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many -->
<!-- formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph -->
<!-- environment, as used here. -->

<P>
<B>Step 1.</B> Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form <TT>mydoc.p.tex</TT> for
     <TT>ptex2tex</TT>:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files <TT>newcommands.tex</TT>, <TT>newcommands_keep.tex</TT>, or
<TT>newcommands_replace.tex</TT> (see the section <A HREF="#newcommands">Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography</a>).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

<P>
<B>Step 2.</B> Run <TT>ptex2tex</TT> (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
or just perform a plain copy,
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
Doconce generates a <TT>.p.tex</TT> file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
A separate titlepage can be generate by
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
The <TT>ptex2tex</TT> tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any <TT>!bc</TT> command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your <TT>.ptex2tex.cfg</TT>
file, e.g., <TT>!bc cod</TT> for a code snippet, where <TT>cod</TT> is set to
a certain environment in <TT>.ptex2tex.cfg</TT> (e.g., <TT>CodeIntended</TT>).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

<P>
<B>Step 3.</B> Compile <TT>mydoc.tex</TT>
and create the PDF file:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
If one wishes to use the <TT>Minted_Python</TT>, <TT>Minted_Cpp</TT>, etc., environments
in <TT>ptex2tex</TT> for typesetting code, the <TT>minted</TT> LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running <TT>doconce format</TT> with the
<TT>-DMINTED</TT> option:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
In this case, <TT>latex</TT> must be run with the
<TT>-shell-escape</TT> option:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The <TT>-shell-escape</TT> option is required because the <TT>minted.sty</TT> style
file runs the <TT>pygments</TT> program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from <TT>latex</TT> without the <TT>-shell-escape</TT> option.

<P>

<P>
<H3>Plain ASCII Text</H3>
<P>
We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
<H3>reStructuredText</H3>
<P>
Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file <TT>mydoc.rst</TT>:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
We may now produce various other formats:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The OpenOffice file <TT>mydoc.odt</TT> can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

<P>
<H3>Sphinx</H3>
<P>
Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the <TT>doconce sphinx_dir</TT> command:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The keywords <TT>author</TT>, <TT>title</TT>, and <TT>version</TT> are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, <TT>version</TT> is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files <TT>file1</TT>,
<TT>file2</TT>, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files <TT>file1</TT>, <TT>file2</TT>, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of <TT>dirname</TT> is <TT>sphinx-rootdir</TT>. The <TT>theme</TT>
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is <TT>'default'</TT>).

<P>
With a single-file document in <TT>mydoc.do.txt</TT> one often just runs
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory <TT>sphinx-rootdir</TT> is made with
relevant files.

<P>
The <TT>doconce sphinx_dir</TT> command generates a script
<TT>automake-sphinx.sh</TT> for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named <TT>figs</TT> or <TT>figures</TT>
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, <TT>automake-sphinx.sh</TT> must be edited accordingly. One
can either run <TT>automake-sphinx.sh</TT> or perform the steps in the
script manually.

<P>
Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the <TT>conf.py</TT>
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
<TT>make-themes.sh</TT> can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes <TT>fenics</TT> and <TT>pyramid</TT>, one writes
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The resulting directories with HTML documents are <TT>_build/html_fenics</TT>
and <TT>_build/html_pyramid</TT>, respectively. Without arguments,
<TT>make-themes.sh</TT> makes all available themes (!).

<P>
If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file <TT>mydoc.do.txt</TT>.

<P>
<B>Step 1.</B> Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
<B>Step 2.</B> Create a Sphinx root directory with a <TT>conf.py</TT> file,
either manually or by using the interactive <TT>sphinx-quickstart</TT>
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
<B>Step 3.</B> Copy the <TT>tutorial.rst</TT> file to the Sphinx root directory:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with <TT>mydoc.rst</TT> in the <TT>sphinx-rootdir</TT>
directory. Either edit <TT>mydoc.rst</TT> so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to <TT>sphinx-rootdir</TT>.

<P>
<B>Step 4.</B> Edit the generated <TT>index.rst</TT> file so that <TT>mydoc.rst</TT>
is included, i.e., add <TT>mydoc</TT> to the <TT>toctree</TT> section so that it becomes
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
(The spaces before <TT>mydoc</TT> are important!)

<P>
<B>Step 5.</B> Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
<B>Step 6.</B> View the result:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows <TT>!bc</TT>: <TT>cod</TT> gives Python
(<TT>code-block:: python</TT> in Sphinx syntax) and <TT>cppcod</TT> gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

<P>

<P>
<H3>Google Code Wiki</H3>
<P>
There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax">Google Code</A>.
The transformation to this format, called <TT>gwiki</TT> to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the <TT>mydoc.gwiki</TT> output file from <TT>doconce format</TT> and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press <B>Preview</B> or <B>Save Page</B> to
see the formatted result.

<P>
When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).

<P>

<P>
<H3>Tweaking the Doconce Output</H3>
<P>
Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
<TT>.rst</TT> file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if <TT>.eps</TT> or <TT>.png</TT> is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The <TT>make.sh</TT> files in <TT>docs/manual</TT> and <TT>docs/tutorial</TT>
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

<P>

<P>
<H3>Demos</H3>
<P>
The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The file <TT>make.sh</TT> in the <TT>tutorial</TT> directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, <TT>tutorial.do.txt</TT> is the
starting point.  Running <TT>make.sh</TT> and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original <TT>tutorial.do.txt</TT> file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
<A HREF="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html">Here</A>
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

<P>
There is another demo in the <TT>docs/manual</TT> directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, <TT>manual.do.txt</TT>, to
various formats. The <TT>make.sh</TT> script runs a set of translations.

<P>
<H3>Dependencies</H3>
<P>
If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess">Preprocess</A> or <A HREF="http://www.makotemplates.org">Mako</A> must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex">ptex2tex</A> and some style
files that <TT>ptex2tex</TT> potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires <A HREF="http://docutils.sourceforge.net">docutils</A>.  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course <A HREF="http://sphinx.pocoo.org">Sphinx</A>.
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to <A HREF="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</A> is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
========================================

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen

:Date: Nov 23, 2011

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like `LaTeX <http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf>`_, `HTML <http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/>`_, `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_, `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>`_, and `wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


The Doconce Concept
===================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code,
    say in examples, directly from the source code files.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is obviously a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



What Does Doconce Look Like?
============================

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,

  * bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,

  * *emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks,

  * **words in boldface** are surrounded by underscores,

  * words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset verbatim (monospace font),

  * section headings are recognied by equality (``=``) signs before
    and after the text, and the number of ``=`` signs indicates the
    level of the section (7 for main section, 5 for subsection,
    3 for subsubsection),

  * paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading,

  * blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    ``!bc`` (begin code) and ``!ec`` (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block,

  * blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files,

  * blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    ``!bt`` (begin TeX) and ``!et`` (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block,

  * there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,

  * figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported,

  * comments can be inserted throughout the text (``#`` at the beginning
    of a line),

  * with a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text,

  * with the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format::


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

.. _my:first:sec:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
**boldface** words, *emphasized* words, and ``computer`` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1

  * item 2

  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an ``o``
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1

 2. item 2

 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in `<tutorial.do.txt>`_.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section `A Subsection with Sample Text`_.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as (**hpl**: here I will make
some remarks to the text) for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section `From Doconce to Other Formats`_ for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x),
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as::


        $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
``!bt`` and ``!et`` (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{eqnarray}

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
``!bc`` and ``!ec`` instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like::


        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

It is possible to add a specification of a (ptex2tex-style)
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., ``!bc xxx``
where ``xxx`` is an identifier like ``pycod`` for code snippet in Python,
``sys`` for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ptex2tex and defined in a
configuration file ``.ptext2tex.cfg``, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments)::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, ``pro`` and ``cod`` are ``python``, ``sys`` is ``console``,
while ``xpro`` and ``xcod`` are computer language specific for ``x``
in ``f`` (Fortran), ``c`` (C), ``cpp`` (C++), and ``py`` (Python).
.. ``rb`` (Ruby), ``pl`` (Perl), and ``sh`` (Unix shell).


.. (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code

.. blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments

.. and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the

.. first one is used.)


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with ``!bc pro``, while a part of a file is copied into a ``!bc cod``
environment. What ``pro`` and ``cod`` mean is then defined through
a ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` file for LaTeX and a ``sphinx code-blocks``
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing ``#include "mynote.do.txt"``
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension ``do.txt``. The ``do`` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing ``.txt`` denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


.. _newcommands:

Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
``newcommand_replace.tex`` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names ``newcommands.tex`` and
``newcommands_keep.tex`` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
``!bt`` and ``!et`` in ``newcommands_keep.tex`` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
``newcommands_replace.tex`` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the ``newcommands*.tex`` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the ``doc/manual/manual.do.txt`` file (see the
`demo page <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>`_
for various formats of this document).


.. Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess):



.. _doconce2formats:

From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document ``mydoc.do.txt`` to various other
formats applies the script ``doconce format``::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable ``FORMAT`` is always defined as the current format when
running ``preprocess``. That is, in the last example, ``FORMAT`` is
defined as ``latex``. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like ``#if FORMAT == "latex"``.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file ``mydoc.html`` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file ``mydoc.tex`` from ``mydoc.do.txt`` is done in two steps:
.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many

.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph

.. environment, as used here.


*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form ``mydoc.p.tex`` for
     ``ptex2tex``::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files ``newcommands.tex``, ``newcommands_keep.tex``, or
``newcommands_replace.tex`` (see the section `Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography`_).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ``ptex2tex`` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a ``.p.tex`` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc

A separate titlepage can be generate by::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc


The ``ptex2tex`` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any ``!bc`` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
file, e.g., ``!bc cod`` for a code snippet, where ``cod`` is set to
a certain environment in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` (e.g., ``CodeIntended``).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

*Step 3.* Compile ``mydoc.tex``
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the ``Minted_Python``, ``Minted_Cpp``, etc., environments
in ``ptex2tex`` for typesetting code, the ``minted`` LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running ``doconce format`` with the
``-DMINTED`` option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, ``latex`` must be run with the
``-shell-escape`` option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

The ``-shell-escape`` option is required because the ``minted.sty`` style
file runs the ``pygments`` program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from ``latex`` without the ``-shell-escape`` option.


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file ``mydoc.rst``::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file ``mydoc.odt`` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords ``author``, ``title``, and ``version`` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, ``version`` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files ``file1``,
``file2``, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files ``file1``, ``file2``, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of ``dirname`` is ``sphinx-rootdir``. The ``theme``
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ``'default'``).

With a single-file document in ``mydoc.do.txt`` one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory ``sphinx-rootdir`` is made with
relevant files.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command generates a script
``automake-sphinx.sh`` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named ``figs`` or ``figures``
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, ``automake-sphinx.sh`` must be edited accordingly. One
can either run ``automake-sphinx.sh`` or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the ``conf.py``
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
``make-themes.sh`` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes ``fenics`` and ``pyramid``, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are ``_build/html_fenics``
and ``_build/html_pyramid``, respectively. Without arguments,
``make-themes.sh`` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file ``mydoc.do.txt``.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory with a ``conf.py`` file,
either manually or by using the interactive ``sphinx-quickstart``
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


*Step 3.* Copy the ``tutorial.rst`` file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with ``mydoc.rst`` in the ``sphinx-rootdir``
directory. Either edit ``mydoc.rst`` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to ``sphinx-rootdir``.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated ``index.rst`` file so that ``mydoc.rst``
is included, i.e., add ``mydoc`` to the ``toctree`` section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before ``mydoc`` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows ``!bc``: ``cod`` gives Python
(``code-block:: python`` in Sphinx syntax) and ``cppcod`` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Google Code Wiki
----------------

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by `Google Code <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_.
The transformation to this format, called ``gwiki`` to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the ``mydoc.gwiki`` output file from ``doconce format`` and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press **Preview** or **Save Page** to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
``.rst`` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if ``.eps`` or ``.png`` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The ``make.sh`` files in ``docs/manual`` and ``docs/tutorial``
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file ``make.sh`` in the ``tutorial`` directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, ``tutorial.do.txt`` is the
starting point.  Running ``make.sh`` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original ``tutorial.do.txt`` file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
`Here <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>`_
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the ``docs/manual`` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, ``manual.do.txt``, to
various formats. The ``make.sh`` script runs a set of translations.

Dependencies
------------

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either `Preprocess <http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_ or `Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org>`_ must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_ and some style
files that ``ptex2tex`` potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_.  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_.
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
========================================

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen

:Date: Nov 23, 2011

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like `LaTeX <http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf>`_, `HTML <http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/>`_, `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_, `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>`_, and `wiki <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


The Doconce Concept
===================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code,
    say in examples, directly from the source code files.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is obviously a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



What Does Doconce Look Like?
============================

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,

  * bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,

  * *emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks,

  * **words in boldface** are surrounded by underscores,

  * words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset verbatim (monospace font),

  * section headings are recognied by equality (``=``) signs before
    and after the text, and the number of ``=`` signs indicates the
    level of the section (7 for main section, 5 for subsection,
    3 for subsubsection),

  * paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading,

  * blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    ``!bc`` (begin code) and ``!ec`` (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block,

  * blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files,

  * blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    ``!bt`` (begin TeX) and ``!et`` (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block,

  * there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,

  * figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported,

  * comments can be inserted throughout the text (``#`` at the beginning
    of a line),

  * with a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text,

  * with the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:

.. code-block:: py


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

.. _my:first:sec:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
**boldface** words, *emphasized* words, and ``computer`` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1

  * item 2

  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an ``o``
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1

 2. item 2

 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in `hpl <http://folk.uio.no/hpl>`_.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in `<tutorial.do.txt>`_.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section :ref:`my:first:sec`.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as (**hpl**: here I will make
some remarks to the text) for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section :ref:`doconce2formats` for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624

Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as :math:`\nu = \sin(x)`,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like :math:`\nu = \sin(x)` is
typeset as

.. code-block:: py


        $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
``!bt`` and ``!et`` (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:

.. math::
   :label: myeq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla^2 u + f, \\
        {\partial v\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
``!bc`` and ``!ec`` instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like

.. code-block:: py

        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

It is possible to add a specification of a (ptex2tex-style)
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., ``!bc xxx``
where ``xxx`` is an identifier like ``pycod`` for code snippet in Python,
``sys`` for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ptex2tex and defined in a
configuration file ``.ptext2tex.cfg``, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):

.. code-block:: py


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, ``pro`` and ``cod`` are ``python``, ``sys`` is ``console``,
while ``xpro`` and ``xcod`` are computer language specific for ``x``
in ``f`` (Fortran), ``c`` (C), ``cpp`` (C++), and ``py`` (Python).
.. ``rb`` (Ruby), ``pl`` (Perl), and ``sh`` (Unix shell).


.. (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code

.. blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments

.. and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the

.. first one is used.)


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with ``!bc pro``, while a part of a file is copied into a ``!bc cod``
environment. What ``pro`` and ``cod`` mean is then defined through
a ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` file for LaTeX and a ``sphinx code-blocks``
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing ``#include "mynote.do.txt"``
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension ``do.txt``. The ``do`` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing ``.txt`` denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


.. _newcommands:

Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
``newcommand_replace.tex`` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names ``newcommands.tex`` and
``newcommands_keep.tex`` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
``!bt`` and ``!et`` in ``newcommands_keep.tex`` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
``newcommands_replace.tex`` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the ``newcommands*.tex`` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the ``doc/manual/manual.do.txt`` file (see the
`demo page <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>`_
for various formats of this document).


.. Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess):



.. _doconce2formats:

From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document ``mydoc.do.txt`` to various other
formats applies the script ``doconce format``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` can be added after the
filename. For example,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable ``FORMAT`` is always defined as the current format when
running ``preprocess``. That is, in the last example, ``FORMAT`` is
defined as ``latex``. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like ``#if FORMAT == "latex"``.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code:

.. code-block:: py


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is performed by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file ``mydoc.html`` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file ``mydoc.tex`` from ``mydoc.do.txt`` is done in two steps:
.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many

.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph

.. environment, as used here.


*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form ``mydoc.p.tex`` for
     ``ptex2tex``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files ``newcommands.tex``, ``newcommands_keep.tex``, or
``newcommands_replace.tex`` (see the section :ref:`newcommands`).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ``ptex2tex`` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a ``.p.tex`` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc

A separate titlepage can be generate by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc


The ``ptex2tex`` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any ``!bc`` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
file, e.g., ``!bc cod`` for a code snippet, where ``cod`` is set to
a certain environment in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` (e.g., ``CodeIntended``).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

*Step 3.* Compile ``mydoc.tex``
and create the PDF file:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the ``Minted_Python``, ``Minted_Cpp``, etc., environments
in ``ptex2tex`` for typesetting code, the ``minted`` LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running ``doconce format`` with the
``-DMINTED`` option:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, ``latex`` must be run with the
``-shell-escape`` option:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

The ``-shell-escape`` option is required because the ``minted.sty`` style
file runs the ``pygments`` program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from ``latex`` without the ``-shell-escape`` option.


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file ``mydoc.rst``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file ``mydoc.odt`` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords ``author``, ``title``, and ``version`` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, ``version`` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files ``file1``,
``file2``, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files ``file1``, ``file2``, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of ``dirname`` is ``sphinx-rootdir``. The ``theme``
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ``'default'``).

With a single-file document in ``mydoc.do.txt`` one often just runs

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory ``sphinx-rootdir`` is made with
relevant files.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command generates a script
``automake-sphinx.sh`` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named ``figs`` or ``figures``
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, ``automake-sphinx.sh`` must be edited accordingly. One
can either run ``automake-sphinx.sh`` or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the ``conf.py``
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
``make-themes.sh`` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes ``fenics`` and ``pyramid``, one writes

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are ``_build/html_fenics``
and ``_build/html_pyramid``, respectively. Without arguments,
``make-themes.sh`` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file ``mydoc.do.txt``.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory with a ``conf.py`` file,
either manually or by using the interactive ``sphinx-quickstart``
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:

.. code-block:: console

        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


*Step 3.* Copy the ``tutorial.rst`` file to the Sphinx root directory:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with ``mydoc.rst`` in the ``sphinx-rootdir``
directory. Either edit ``mydoc.rst`` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to ``sphinx-rootdir``.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated ``index.rst`` file so that ``mydoc.rst``
is included, i.e., add ``mydoc`` to the ``toctree`` section so that it becomes

.. code-block:: py


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before ``mydoc`` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:

.. code-block:: console

        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


*Step 6.* View the result:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows ``!bc``: ``cod`` gives Python
(``code-block:: python`` in Sphinx syntax) and ``cppcod`` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Google Code Wiki
----------------

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by `Google Code <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_.
The transformation to this format, called ``gwiki`` to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the ``mydoc.gwiki`` output file from ``doconce format`` and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press **Preview** or **Save Page** to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
``.rst`` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if ``.eps`` or ``.png`` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The ``make.sh`` files in ``docs/manual`` and ``docs/tutorial``
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file

.. code-block:: py


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file ``make.sh`` in the ``tutorial`` directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, ``tutorial.do.txt`` is the
starting point.  Running ``make.sh`` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original ``tutorial.do.txt`` file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
`Here <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>`_
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the ``docs/manual`` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, ``manual.do.txt``, to
various formats. The ``make.sh`` script runs a set of translations.

Dependencies
------------

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either `Preprocess <http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_ or `Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org>`_ must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_ and some style
files that ``ptex2tex`` potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_.  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_.
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

#summary Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />
By *Hans Petter Langtangen*

==== Nov 23, 2011 ====

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage   eventually go with a particular format?
 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various   formats like [http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf LaTeX], [http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/ HTML], [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html reStructuredText], [http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html Sphinx], and [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax wiki]? Would it be convenient   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?
 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.



== The Doconce Concept ==

Doconce is two things:


 # Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the    latter to RTF and MS Word.    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)
 # Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:


  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than    LaTeX and HTML.
  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code,    say in examples, directly from the source code files.
  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,    Pandoc is obviously a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:


  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



== What Does Doconce Look Like? ==

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,


  * bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,
  * *emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks,
  * *words in boldface* are surrounded by underscores,
  * words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and    then typeset verbatim (monospace font),
  * section headings are recognied by equality (`=`) signs before    and after the text, and the number of `=` signs indicates the    level of the section (7 for main section, 5 for subsection,    3 for subsubsection),
  * paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore    before and after the heading,
  * blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing    `!bc` (begin code) and `!ec` (end code) commands at separate lines    before and after the code block,
  * blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files,
  * blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing    `!bt` (begin TeX) and `!et` (end TeX) commands at separate lines    before and after the math block,
  * there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,
  * figures and movies with captions, simple tables,    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported,
  * comments can be inserted throughout the text (`#` at the beginning    of a line),
  * with a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined    in or out of the text,
  * with the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
{{{
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
}}}
The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

==== A Subsection with Sample Text ====

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
*boldface* words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,


  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an `o`
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:


 # item 1
 # item 2
 # item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in [http://folk.uio.no/hpl hpl].
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in tutorial.do.txt.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section [#A_Subsection_with_Sample_Text].

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats] for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,


 ||      *time*       ||    *velocity*     ||  *acceleration*   ||
 ||  0.0              ||  1.4186           ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  2.0              ||  1.376512         ||  11.919           ||
 ||  4.0              ||  1.1E+1           ||  14.717624        ||

==== Mathematics and Computer Code ====

Inline mathematics, such as `v = sin(x)`,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like `v = sin(x)` is
typeset as
{{{
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
}}}
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
`!bt` and `!et` (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:
{{{
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{eqnarray}
}}}
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
`!bc` and `!ec` instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like
{{{
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
}}}
It is possible to add a specification of a (ptex2tex-style)
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., `!bc xxx`
where `xxx` is an identifier like `pycod` for code snippet in Python,
`sys` for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ptex2tex and defined in a
configuration file `.ptext2tex.cfg`, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
By default, `pro` and `cod` are `python`, `sys` is `console`,
while `xpro` and `xcod` are computer language specific for `x`
in `f` (Fortran), `c` (C), `cpp` (C++), and `py` (Python).
<wiki:comment> `rb` (Ruby), `pl` (Perl), and `sh` (Unix shell). </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> first one is used.) </wiki:comment>

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with `!bc pro`, while a part of a file is copied into a `!bc cod`
environment. What `pro` and `cod` mean is then defined through
a `.ptex2tex.cfg` file for LaTeX and a `sphinx code-blocks`
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing `#include "mynote.do.txt"`
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension `do.txt`. The `do` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing `.txt` denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.

==== Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography ====

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the `doc/manual/manual.do.txt` file (see the
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html demo page]
for various formats of this document).


<wiki:comment> Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess): </wiki:comment>



== From Doconce to Other Formats ==

Transformation of a Doconce document `mydoc.do.txt` to various other
formats applies the script `doconce format`:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
}}}
or just
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
}}}
The `mako` or `preprocess` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to `mako` or `preprocess` can be added after the
filename. For example,
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
}}}
The variable `FORMAT` is always defined as the current format when
running `preprocess`. That is, in the last example, `FORMAT` is
defined as `latex`. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like `#if FORMAT == "latex"`.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments
}}}
One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code:
{{{
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
}}}
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

==== HTML ====

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file `mydoc.do.txt`
is performed by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
}}}
The resulting file `mydoc.html` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

==== LaTeX ====

Making a LaTeX file `mydoc.tex` from `mydoc.do.txt` is done in two steps:
<wiki:comment> Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> environment, as used here. </wiki:comment>

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form `mydoc.p.tex` for
     `ptex2tex`:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
}}}
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files `newcommands.tex`, `newcommands_keep.tex`, or
`newcommands_replace.tex` (see the section [#Macros_(Newcommands),_Cross-References,_Index,_and_Bibliography]).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run `ptex2tex` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
}}}
or just perform a plain copy,
{{{
Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex
}}}
Doconce generates a `.p.tex` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
}}}
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc
}}}
A separate titlepage can be generate by
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc
}}}

The `ptex2tex` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any `!bc` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your `.ptex2tex.cfg`
file, e.g., `!bc cod` for a code snippet, where `cod` is set to
a certain environment in `.ptex2tex.cfg` (e.g., `CodeIntended`).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

*Step 3.* Compile `mydoc.tex`
and create the PDF file:
{{{
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}
If one wishes to use the `Minted_Python`, `Minted_Cpp`, etc., environments
in `ptex2tex` for typesetting code, the `minted` LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running `doconce format` with the
`-DMINTED` option:
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
}}}
In this case, `latex` must be run with the
`-shell-escape` option:
{{{
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}
The `-shell-escape` option is required because the `minted.sty` style
file runs the `pygments` program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from `latex` without the `-shell-escape` option.

==== Plain ASCII Text ====

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
}}}

==== reStructuredText ====

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file `mydoc.rst`:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
}}}
We may now produce various other formats:
{{{
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
}}}
The OpenOffice file `mydoc.odt` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

==== Sphinx ====

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the `doconce sphinx_dir` command:
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
}}}
The keywords `author`, `title`, and `version` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, `version` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files `file1`,
`file2`, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files `file1`, `file2`, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of `dirname` is `sphinx-rootdir`. The `theme`
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is `'default'`).

With a single-file document in `mydoc.do.txt` one often just runs
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
}}}
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory `sphinx-rootdir` is made with
relevant files.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` command generates a script
`automake-sphinx.sh` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named `figs` or `figures`
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, `automake-sphinx.sh` must be edited accordingly. One
can either run `automake-sphinx.sh` or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the `conf.py`
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
`make-themes.sh` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes `fenics` and `pyramid`, one writes
{{{
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
}}}
The resulting directories with HTML documents are `_build/html_fenics`
and `_build/html_pyramid`, respectively. Without arguments,
`make-themes.sh` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file `mydoc.do.txt`.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
}}}

*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory with a `conf.py` file,
either manually or by using the interactive `sphinx-quickstart`
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
{{{
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
}}}

*Step 3.* Copy the `tutorial.rst` file to the Sphinx root directory:
{{{
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
}}}
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with `mydoc.rst` in the `sphinx-rootdir`
directory. Either edit `mydoc.rst` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to `sphinx-rootdir`.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated `index.rst` file so that `mydoc.rst`
is included, i.e., add `mydoc` to the `toctree` section so that it becomes
{{{
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
}}}
(The spaces before `mydoc` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
{{{
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
}}}

*Step 6.* View the result:
{{{
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
}}}

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows `!bc`: `cod` gives Python
(`code-block:: python` in Sphinx syntax) and `cppcod` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

==== Google Code Wiki ====

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax Google Code].
The transformation to this format, called `gwiki` to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
}}}
You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the `mydoc.gwiki` output file from `doconce format` and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press *Preview* or *Save Page* to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).

==== Tweaking the Doconce Output ====

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
`.rst` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if `.eps` or `.png` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The `make.sh` files in `docs/manual` and `docs/tutorial`
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

==== Demos ====

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file
{{{
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
}}}
The file `make.sh` in the `tutorial` directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, `tutorial.do.txt` is the
starting point.  Running `make.sh` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original `tutorial.do.txt` file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html Here]
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the `docs/manual` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, `manual.do.txt`, to
various formats. The `make.sh` script runs a set of translations.

==== Dependencies ====

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either [http://code.google.com/p/preprocess Preprocess] or [http://www.makotemplates.org Mako] must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need [http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex ptex2tex] and some style
files that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires [http://docutils.sourceforge.net docutils].  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course [http://sphinx.pocoo.org Sphinx].
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ Pandoc] is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

TITLE: Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Simula Research Laboratory, and University of Oslo)DATE: today


 - When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?
 - Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like "http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf":LaTeX, "http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/":HTML, "http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html":reStructuredText, "http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html":Sphinx, and "http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax":wiki? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?
 - Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.
The Doconce Concept
Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)
 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  - Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  - Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  - Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code,
    say in examples, directly from the source code files.
  - Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  - Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  - Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is obviously a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  - Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  - Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  - Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.
What Does Doconce Look Like?
Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,

  - bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,
  - *emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks,
  - **words in boldface** are surrounded by underscores,
  - words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset verbatim (monospace font),
  - section headings are recognied by equality ('=') signs before
    and after the text, and the number of '=' signs indicates the
    level of the section (7 for main section, 5 for subsection,
    3 for subsubsection),
  - paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading,
  - blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    '!bc' (begin code) and '!ec' (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block,
  - blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files,
  - blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    '!bt' (begin TeX) and '!et' (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block,
  - there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,
  - figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported,
  - comments can be inserted throughout the text ('#' at the beginning
    of a line),
  - with a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text,
  - with the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format::


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:
A Subsection with Sample Text
Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
**boldface** words, *emphasized* words, and 'computer' words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an 'o'
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1
 2. item 2
 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "http://folk.uio.no/hpl":hpl.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "tutorial.do.txt":tutorial.do.txt.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section "A Subsection with Sample Text".

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624

Mathematics and Computer Code
Inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x),
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as::


        $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
'!bt' and '!et' (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{eqnarray}

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
'!bc' and '!ec' instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like::


        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

It is possible to add a specification of a (ptex2tex-style)
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., '!bc xxx'
where 'xxx' is an identifier like 'pycod' for code snippet in Python,
'sys' for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ptex2tex and defined in a
configuration file '.ptext2tex.cfg', while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments)::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, 'pro' and 'cod' are 'python', 'sys' is 'console',
while 'xpro' and 'xcod' are computer language specific for 'x'
in 'f' (Fortran), 'c' (C), 'cpp' (C++), and 'py' (Python).


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with '!bc pro', while a part of a file is copied into a '!bc cod'
environment. What 'pro' and 'cod' mean is then defined through
a '.ptex2tex.cfg' file for LaTeX and a 'sphinx code-blocks'
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing '#include "mynote.do.txt"'
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension 'do.txt'. The 'do' part stands for doconce, while the
trailing '.txt' denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.
Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
'newcommand_replace.tex' are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names 'newcommands.tex' and
'newcommands_keep.tex' are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
'!bt' and '!et' in 'newcommands_keep.tex' to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
'newcommands_replace.tex' and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the 'newcommands*.tex' files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the 'doc/manual/manual.do.txt' file (see the
"https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html":demo page
for various formats of this document).
From Doconce to Other Formats
Transformation of a Doconce document 'mydoc.do.txt' to various other
formats applies the script 'doconce format':
!bc   sys
        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The 'mako' or 'preprocess' programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to 'mako' or 'preprocess' can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable 'FORMAT' is always defined as the current format when
running 'preprocess'. That is, in the last example, 'FORMAT' is
defined as 'latex'. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like '#if FORMAT == "latex"'.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.
HTML
Making an HTML version of a Doconce file 'mydoc.do.txt'
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file 'mydoc.html' can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.
LaTeX
Making a LaTeX file 'mydoc.tex' from 'mydoc.do.txt' is done in two steps:

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form 'mydoc.p.tex' for
     'ptex2tex':
!bc   sys
        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files 'newcommands.tex', 'newcommands_keep.tex', or
'newcommands_replace.tex' (see the section "Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run 'ptex2tex' (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a '.p.tex' file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc

A separate titlepage can be generate by::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc


The 'ptex2tex' tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any '!bc' command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your '.ptex2tex.cfg'
file, e.g., '!bc cod' for a code snippet, where 'cod' is set to
a certain environment in '.ptex2tex.cfg' (e.g., 'CodeIntended').
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

*Step 3.* Compile 'mydoc.tex'
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the 'Minted_Python', 'Minted_Cpp', etc., environments
in 'ptex2tex' for typesetting code, the 'minted' LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running 'doconce format' with the
'-DMINTED' option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, 'latex' must be run with the
'-shell-escape' option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

The '-shell-escape' option is required because the 'minted.sty' style
file runs the 'pygments' program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from 'latex' without the '-shell-escape' option.
Plain ASCII Text
We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt

reStructuredText
Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file 'mydoc.rst':
!bc   sys
        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file 'mydoc.odt' can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.
Sphinx
Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the 'doconce sphinx_dir' command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords 'author', 'title', and 'version' are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, 'version' is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files 'file1',
'file2', etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files 'file1', 'file2', etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of 'dirname' is 'sphinx-rootdir'. The 'theme'
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ''default'').

With a single-file document in 'mydoc.do.txt' one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory 'sphinx-rootdir' is made with
relevant files.

The 'doconce sphinx_dir' command generates a script
'automake-sphinx.sh' for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named 'figs' or 'figures'
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, 'automake-sphinx.sh' must be edited accordingly. One
can either run 'automake-sphinx.sh' or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the 'conf.py'
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
'make-themes.sh' can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes 'fenics' and 'pyramid', one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are '_build/html_fenics'
and '_build/html_pyramid', respectively. Without arguments,
'make-themes.sh' makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file 'mydoc.do.txt'.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory with a 'conf.py' file,
either manually or by using the interactive 'sphinx-quickstart'
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


*Step 3.* Copy the 'tutorial.rst' file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with 'mydoc.rst' in the 'sphinx-rootdir'
directory. Either edit 'mydoc.rst' so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to 'sphinx-rootdir'.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated 'index.rst' file so that 'mydoc.rst'
is included, i.e., add 'mydoc' to the 'toctree' section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before 'mydoc' are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows '!bc': 'cod' gives Python
('code-block:: python' in Sphinx syntax) and 'cppcod' gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.
Google Code Wiki
There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by "http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax":Google Code.
The transformation to this format, called 'gwiki' to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the 'mydoc.gwiki' output file from 'doconce format' and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press **Preview** or **Save Page** to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).
Tweaking the Doconce Output
Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
'.rst' file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if '.eps' or '.png' is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The 'make.sh' files in 'docs/manual' and 'docs/tutorial'
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.
Demos
The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file 'make.sh' in the 'tutorial' directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, 'tutorial.do.txt' is the
starting point.  Running 'make.sh' and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original 'tutorial.do.txt' file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
"https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html":Here
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the 'docs/manual' directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, 'manual.do.txt', to
various formats. The 'make.sh' script runs a set of translations.
Dependencies
If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either "http://code.google.com/p/preprocess":Preprocess or "http://www.makotemplates.org":Mako must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex":ptex2tex and some style
files that 'ptex2tex' potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires "http://docutils.sourceforge.net":docutils.  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course "http://sphinx.pocoo.org":Sphinx.
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/":Pandoc is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

TITLE: Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Simula Research Laboratory, and University of Oslo)DATE: today


 - When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?
 - Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like U{LaTeX<http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf>}, U{HTML<http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/>}, U{reStructuredText<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>}, U{Sphinx<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>}, and U{wiki<http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>}? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?
 - Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


The Doconce Concept
===================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)
 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  - Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.
  - Doconce can be converted to plain I{untagged} text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  - Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code,
    say in examples, directly from the source code files.
  - Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  - Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  - Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is obviously a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  - Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.
  - Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  - Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



What Does Doconce Look Like?
============================

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,

  - bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,
  - I{emphasized words} are surrounded by asterisks,
  - B{words in boldface} are surrounded by underscores,
  - words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset verbatim (monospace font),
  - section headings are recognied by equality (C{=}) signs before
    and after the text, and the number of C{=} signs indicates the
    level of the section (7 for main section, 5 for subsection,
    3 for subsubsection),
  - paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading,
  - blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    C{!bc} (begin code) and C{!ec} (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block,
  - blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files,
  - blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    C{!bt} (begin TeX) and C{!et} (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block,
  - there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,
  - figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported,
  - comments can be inserted throughout the text (C{#} at the beginning
    of a line),
  - with a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text,
  - with the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format::


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
B{boldface} words, I{emphasized} words, and C{computer} words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an C{o}
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1
 2. item 2
 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in U{hpl<http://folk.uio.no/hpl>}.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in U{tutorial.do.txt<tutorial.do.txt>}.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section "A Subsection with Sample Text".

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as M{v = sin(x)},
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like M{v = sin(x)} is
typeset as::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
C{!bt} and C{!et} (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
C{!bc} and C{!ec} instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like::


        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

It is possible to add a specification of a (ptex2tex-style)
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., C{!bc xxx}
where C{xxx} is an identifier like C{pycod} for code snippet in Python,
C{sys} for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ptex2tex and defined in a
configuration file C{.ptext2tex.cfg}, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments)::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, C{pro} and C{cod} are C{python}, C{sys} is C{console},
while C{xpro} and C{xcod} are computer language specific for C{x}
in C{f} (Fortran), C{c} (C), C{cpp} (C++), and C{py} (Python).


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with C{!bc pro}, while a part of a file is copied into a C{!bc cod}
environment. What C{pro} and C{cod} mean is then defined through
a C{.ptex2tex.cfg} file for LaTeX and a C{sphinx code-blocks}
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing C{#include "mynote.do.txt"}
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension C{do.txt}. The C{do} part stands for doconce, while the
trailing C{.txt} denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style I{newcommand}
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
C{newcommand_replace.tex} are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names C{newcommands.tex} and
C{newcommands_keep.tex} are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
C{!bt} and C{!et} in C{newcommands_keep.tex} to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
C{newcommands_replace.tex} and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the C{newcommands*.tex} files I{must} appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the C{doc/manual/manual.do.txt} file (see the
U{demo page<https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>}
for various formats of this document).




From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document C{mydoc.do.txt} to various other
formats applies the script C{doconce format}::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The C{mako} or C{preprocess} programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to C{mako} or C{preprocess} can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable C{FORMAT} is always defined as the current format when
running C{preprocess}. That is, in the last example, C{FORMAT} is
defined as C{latex}. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like C{#if FORMAT == "latex"}.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file C{mydoc.do.txt}
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file C{mydoc.html} can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file C{mydoc.tex} from C{mydoc.do.txt} is done in two steps:

I{Step 1.} Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form C{mydoc.p.tex} for
     C{ptex2tex}::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files C{newcommands.tex}, C{newcommands_keep.tex}, or
C{newcommands_replace.tex} (see the section "Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

I{Step 2.} Run C{ptex2tex} (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a C{.p.tex} file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc

A separate titlepage can be generate by::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc


The C{ptex2tex} tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any C{!bc} command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your C{.ptex2tex.cfg}
file, e.g., C{!bc cod} for a code snippet, where C{cod} is set to
a certain environment in C{.ptex2tex.cfg} (e.g., C{CodeIntended}).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

I{Step 3.} Compile C{mydoc.tex}
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the C{Minted_Python}, C{Minted_Cpp}, etc., environments
in C{ptex2tex} for typesetting code, the C{minted} LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running C{doconce format} with the
C{-DMINTED} option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, C{latex} must be run with the
C{-shell-escape} option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

The C{-shell-escape} option is required because the C{minted.sty} style
file runs the C{pygments} program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from C{latex} without the C{-shell-escape} option.


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file C{mydoc.rst}::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file C{mydoc.odt} can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the C{doconce sphinx_dir} command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords C{author}, C{title}, and C{version} are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, C{version} is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files C{file1},
C{file2}, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files C{file1}, C{file2}, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of C{dirname} is C{sphinx-rootdir}. The C{theme}
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is C{'default'}).

With a single-file document in C{mydoc.do.txt} one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory C{sphinx-rootdir} is made with
relevant files.

The C{doconce sphinx_dir} command generates a script
C{automake-sphinx.sh} for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named C{figs} or C{figures}
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, C{automake-sphinx.sh} must be edited accordingly. One
can either run C{automake-sphinx.sh} or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the C{conf.py}
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
C{make-themes.sh} can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes C{fenics} and C{pyramid}, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are C{_build/html_fenics}
and C{_build/html_pyramid}, respectively. Without arguments,
C{make-themes.sh} makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file C{mydoc.do.txt}.

I{Step 1.} Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


I{Step 2.} Create a Sphinx root directory with a C{conf.py} file,
either manually or by using the interactive C{sphinx-quickstart}
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


I{Step 3.} Copy the C{tutorial.rst} file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with C{mydoc.rst} in the C{sphinx-rootdir}
directory. Either edit C{mydoc.rst} so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to C{sphinx-rootdir}.

I{Step 4.} Edit the generated C{index.rst} file so that C{mydoc.rst}
is included, i.e., add C{mydoc} to the C{toctree} section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before C{mydoc} are important!)

I{Step 5.} Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


I{Step 6.} View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows C{!bc}: C{cod} gives Python
(C{code-block:: python} in Sphinx syntax) and C{cppcod} gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Google Code Wiki
----------------

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by U{Google Code<http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>}.
The transformation to this format, called C{gwiki} to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the C{mydoc.gwiki} output file from C{doconce format} and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press B{Preview} or B{Save Page} to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
C{.rst} file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if C{.eps} or C{.png} is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The C{make.sh} files in C{docs/manual} and C{docs/tutorial}
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file C{make.sh} in the C{tutorial} directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, C{tutorial.do.txt} is the
starting point.  Running C{make.sh} and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original C{tutorial.do.txt} file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
U{Here<https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>}
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the C{docs/manual} directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, C{manual.do.txt}, to
various formats. The C{make.sh} script runs a set of translations.

Dependencies
------------

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either U{Preprocess<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>} or U{Mako<http://www.makotemplates.org>} must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need U{ptex2tex<http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>} and some style
files that C{ptex2tex} potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires U{docutils<http://docutils.sourceforge.net>}.  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course U{Sphinx<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>}.
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to U{Pandoc<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>} is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
========================================

Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2] 

[1] Simula Research Laboratory
[2] University of Oslo


Date: Nov 23, 2011

 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage
   eventually go with a particular format?

 * Do you need to write documents in varying formats but find it
   difficult to remember all the typesetting details of various
   formats like LaTeX (http://refcards.com/docs/silvermanj/amslatex/LaTeXRefCard.v2.0.pdf), HTML (http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/), reStructuredText (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html), Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html), and wiki (http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax)? Would it be convenient
   to generate the typesetting details of a particular format from a
   very simple text-like format with minimal tagging?

 * Do you have the same information scattered around in different
   documents in different typesetting formats? Would it be a good idea
   to write things once, in one format, stored in one place, and
   include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


The Doconce Concept
===================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
    LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code,
    say in examples, directly from the source code files.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is obviously a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.



What Does Doconce Look Like?
============================

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,

  * bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,

  * *emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks,

  * _words in boldface_ are surrounded by underscores,

  * words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and
    then typeset verbatim (monospace font),

  * section headings are recognied by equality (=) signs before
    and after the text, and the number of = signs indicates the
    level of the section (7 for main section, 5 for subsection,
    3 for subsubsection),

  * paragraph headings are recognized by a double underscore
    before and after the heading,

  * blocks of computer code can easily be included by placing
    !bc (begin code) and !ec (end code) commands at separate lines
    before and after the code block,

  * blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files,

  * blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included by placing
    !bt (begin TeX) and !et (end TeX) commands at separate lines
    before and after the math block,

  * there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,

  * figures and movies with captions, simple tables,
    URLs with links, index list, labels and references are supported,

  * comments can be inserted throughout the text (# at the beginning
    of a line),

  * with a simple preprocessor, Preprocess or Mako, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text,

  * with the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format::


        ===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
        label{my:first:sec}
        
        Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
        _boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
        natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,
        
          * item 1
          * item 2
          * item 3
        
        Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,
        
          o item 1
          o item 2
          o item 3
        
        URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
        If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
        as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".
        
        References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
        "label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
        Section ref{my:first:sec}.
        
        Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
        some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
        comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
        (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an example).
        
        Tables are also supperted, e.g.,
        
          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |---r-------r-----------r--------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|
        
        # lines beginning with # are comment lines

The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

A Subsection with Sample Text
-----------------------------

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and computer words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1

  * item 2

  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an o
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

 1. item 1

 2. item 2

 3. item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in hpl (http://folk.uio.no/hpl).
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in tutorial.do.txt.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
the section "A Subsection with Sample Text".

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see the section "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

Mathematics and Computer Code
-----------------------------

Inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x),
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as::


        $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$

The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside::

The result looks like this::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{eqnarray}

Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with::


        !bc  cod
        from math import sin, pi
        def myfunc(x):
            return sin(pi*x)
        
        import integrate
        I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)

It is possible to add a specification of a (ptex2tex-style)
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., !bc xxx
where xxx is an identifier like pycod for code snippet in Python,
sys for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ptex2tex and defined in a
configuration file .ptext2tex.cfg, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments)::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

By default, pro and cod are python, sys is console,
while xpro and xcod are computer language specific for x
in f (Fortran), c (C), cpp (C++), and py (Python).


One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with !bc pro, while a part of a file is copied into a !bc cod
environment. What pro and cod mean is then defined through
a .ptex2tex.cfg file for LaTeX and a sphinx code-blocks
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing #include "mynote.do.txt"
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension do.txt. The do part stands for doconce, while the
trailing .txt denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
newcommand_replace.tex are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names newcommands.tex and
newcommands_keep.tex are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by::

least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
newcommands_replace.tex and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the newcommands*.tex files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the doc/manual/manual.do.txt file (see the
demo page (https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html)
for various formats of this document).




From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document mydoc.do.txt to various other
formats applies the script doconce format::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The mako or preprocess programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to mako or preprocess can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable FORMAT is always defined as the current format when
running preprocess. That is, in the last example, FORMAT is
defined as latex. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like #if FORMAT == "latex".

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file mydoc.do.txt
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file mydoc.html can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file mydoc.tex from mydoc.do.txt is done in two steps:

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form mydoc.p.tex for
     ptex2tex::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files newcommands.tex, newcommands_keep.tex, or
newcommands_replace.tex (see the section "Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ptex2tex (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a .p.tex file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc

A separate titlepage can be generate by::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc


The ptex2tex tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any !bc command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your .ptex2tex.cfg
file, e.g., !bc cod for a code snippet, where cod is set to
a certain environment in .ptex2tex.cfg (e.g., CodeIntended).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

*Step 3.* Compile mydoc.tex
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the Minted_Python, Minted_Cpp, etc., environments
in ptex2tex for typesetting code, the minted LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running doconce format with the
-DMINTED option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, latex must be run with the
-shell-escape option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

The -shell-escape option is required because the minted.sty style
file runs the pygments program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from latex without the -shell-escape option.


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file mydoc.rst::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file mydoc.odt can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the doconce sphinx_dir command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords author, title, and version are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, version is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files file1,
file2, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files file1, file2, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of dirname is sphinx-rootdir. The theme
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is 'default').

With a single-file document in mydoc.do.txt one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory sphinx-rootdir is made with
relevant files.

The doconce sphinx_dir command generates a script
automake-sphinx.sh for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named figs or figures
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, automake-sphinx.sh must be edited accordingly. One
can either run automake-sphinx.sh or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the conf.py
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
make-themes.sh can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes fenics and pyramid, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are _build/html_fenics
and _build/html_pyramid, respectively. Without arguments,
make-themes.sh makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file mydoc.do.txt.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory with a conf.py file,
either manually or by using the interactive sphinx-quickstart
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


*Step 3.* Copy the tutorial.rst file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with mydoc.rst in the sphinx-rootdir
directory. Either edit mydoc.rst so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to sphinx-rootdir.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated index.rst file so that mydoc.rst
is included, i.e., add mydoc to the toctree section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before mydoc are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows !bc: cod gives Python
(code-block:: python in Sphinx syntax) and cppcod gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Google Code Wiki
----------------

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax).
The transformation to this format, called gwiki to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the mydoc.gwiki output file from doconce format and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press _Preview_ or _Save Page_ to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
.rst file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if .eps or .png is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The make.sh files in docs/manual and docs/tutorial
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.


Demos
-----

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

The file make.sh in the tutorial directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, tutorial.do.txt is the
starting point.  Running make.sh and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original tutorial.do.txt file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
Here (https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html)
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the docs/manual directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, manual.do.txt, to
various formats. The make.sh script runs a set of translations.

Dependencies
------------

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either Preprocess (http://code.google.com/p/preprocess) or Mako (http://www.makotemplates.org) must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need ptex2tex (http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex) and some style
files that ptex2tex potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires docutils (http://docutils.sourceforge.net).  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org).
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to Pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

_______First Section_______


Here is some
text for section 1.

This is a *first* example of using the _DocWriter
module_ for writing documents from *Python* scripts.
It could be a nice tool since we do not need to bother
with special typesetting, such as `fixed width fonts`
in plain text.

_____First Subsection_____

Some text for the subsection.

__Test of a Paragraph.__ 
Some paragraph text taken from "Documenting Python": The Python language
has a substantial body of documentation, much of it contributed by various
authors. The markup used for the Python documentation is based on
LaTeX and requires a significant set of macros written specifically
for documenting Python. This document describes the macros introduced
to support Python documentation and how they should be used to support
a wide range of output formats.

This document describes the document classes and special markup used
in the Python documentation. Authors may use this guide, in
conjunction with the template files provided with the distribution, to
create or maintain whole documents or sections.

If you're interested in contributing to Python's documentation,
there's no need to learn LaTeX if you're not so inclined; plain text
contributions are more than welcome as well.
Here is an enumerate list:
o item1
o item2

    o subitem1
    o subitem2

o item3

    o subitem3
    o subitem4
...with some trailing text.
___First Subsubsection with an Itemize List___


* item1
* item2

    * subitem1
    * subitem2

* item3

    * subitem3
    * subitem4
Here is some Python code:
!bc

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

b = B()
b.item = 0  # create a new attribute

!ec

_______Second Section_______

Here is a description list:
- keyword1:  item1
- keyword2:  item2 goes here, with a colon : and some text after

    - key3:  subitem1
    - key4:  subitem2

- key5:  item3

    - key6:  subitem3
    - key7:  subitem4


And here is a table:

_______First Section_______


Here is some
text for section 1.

This is a *first* example of using the _DocWriter
module_ for writing documents from *Python* scripts.
It could be a nice tool since we do not need to bother
with special typesetting, such as `fixed width fonts`
in plain text.

_____First Subsection_____

Some text for the subsection.

__Test of a Paragraph.__ 
Some paragraph text taken from "Documenting Python": The Python language
has a substantial body of documentation, much of it contributed by various
authors. The markup used for the Python documentation is based on
LaTeX and requires a significant set of macros written specifically
for documenting Python. This document describes the macros introduced
to support Python documentation and how they should be used to support
a wide range of output formats.

This document describes the document classes and special markup used
in the Python documentation. Authors may use this guide, in
conjunction with the template files provided with the distribution, to
create or maintain whole documents or sections.

If you're interested in contributing to Python's documentation,
there's no need to learn LaTeX if you're not so inclined; plain text
contributions are more than welcome as well.
Here is an enumerate list:
o item1
o item2

    o subitem1
    o subitem2

o item3

    o subitem3
    o subitem4
...with some trailing text.
___First Subsubsection with an Itemize List___


* item1
* item2

    * subitem1
    * subitem2

* item3

    * subitem3
    * subitem4
Here is some Python code:
!bc

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

b = B()
b.item = 0  # create a new attribute

!ec

_______Second Section_______

Here is a description list:
- keyword1:  item1
- keyword2:  item2 goes here, with a colon : and some text after

    - key3:  subitem1
    - key4:  subitem2

- key5:  item3

    - key6:  subitem3
    - key7:  subitem4


And here is a table:

   | a                 | b                 |
   | c                 | d                 |
   | e                 | and a longer text |

TITLE: Doconce Description
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Simula Research Laboratory and University of Oslo
DATE: today


# lines beginning with # are comment lines


======= What Is Doconce? =======
label{what:is:doconce}
idx{doconce!short explanation}

Doconce is two things:

  o Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)


  o Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".



Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown, Pandoc, and AsciiDoc, but less than reST, and very much
    less than LaTeX and HTML.
  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files.
  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, or MS Word.
    With "ptex2tex": "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex", Doconce can
    display computer code in LaTeX in many sophisticated ways (almost
    50 styles are available).

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    MS Word documents, in wikis, or as Sphinx documents.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting may face problems
when transformed to other formats.



===== Dependencies =====

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either "Preprocess": "http://code.google.com/p/preprocess" or "Mako":
"http://www.makotemplates.org" must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need "ptex2tex": "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex" and some style
files that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires "docutils": "http://docutils.sourceforge.net".  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course "Sphinx": "http://sphinx.pocoo.org".
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to "Pandoc": "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/" is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.


#
# some comment lines that do not affect any formatting
# these lines are simply removed
#
#
#
#
#


===== Demos =====

idx{demos}

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the
!bc sys
docs/manual/manual.do.txt
!ec
file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
"demo web page": "https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html"
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file `make.sh` in the same directory as the `manual.do.txt` file
(the current text) shows how to run `doconce format` on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in
!bc sys
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
!ec
In the `tutorial` directory there is also a `make.sh` file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
"web demo": "https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html"
of the results.

# Example on including another Doconce file:

# #include "../tutorial/_doconce2anything.do.txt"



======= The Doconce Markup Language =======

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

===== Lists =====

An unordered bullet list makes use of the `*` as bullet sign
and is indented as follows

!bc
   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3
!ec

This list gets typeset as

   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3

# #if FORMAT == "gwiki"
(As seen, nested lists in (g)wiki format are not treated well by
Doconce. Plain unnested lists work fine. And the (g)wiki format
automatically puts multiple lines of an item on a single line as
required :-)
# #endif

In an ordered list, each item starts with an `o` (as the first letter
in "ordered"):

!bc
   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3
!ec

resulting in

   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3

# #if FORMAT == "gwiki"
(Again, there are problems with mixing nested lists and liststypes
for the (g)wiki format.)
# #endif

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:

!bc
   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple lines)
!ec

The result becomes

   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple lines)


===== Special Lines =====

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.

idx{`TITLE` keyword} idx{`AUTHOR` keyword} idx{`DATE` keyword}

__Heading with Title and Author(s).__
Lines starting with `TITLE:`, `AUTHOR:`, and `DATE:` are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax
!bc
name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3
!ec
The `at` with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the `and` with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
Multiple authors require multiple `AUTHOR:` lines. All information
associated with `TITLE:` and `AUTHOR:` keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:
!bc
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: November 9, 2016
!ec
Note the how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including reStructuredText and Sphinx)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:
!bc
Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
Kaare Dump [3]
A. Dummy Author

[1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
[2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
[3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
!ec
Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

idx{headlines} idx{section headings}

__Section Headings.__
Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   * 7 underscores or equal signs for sections
   * 5 for subsections
   * 3 for subsubsections
   * 2 underscrores (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by blanks if desired.

Here are some examples:
!bc
======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.

      ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
The running text goes here.

          ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.
!ec

The result for the present format looks like this:

======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.

===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
The running text goes here.

=== Example on a Subsubsection Heading ===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.

======= Special Lines =======

===== Figures =====

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax
!bc
FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption
!ec
The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say `.eps` when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's `convert` utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for `TITLE:` and `AUTHOR:` lines, all information
related to a figure line must be written on the same line. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as `FIGURE:` will be
included in the formatted caption).

FIGURE:[figs/streamtubes, width=400] Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. label{fig:viz}

===== Movies =====

Here is an example on the `MOVIE:` keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the `latex`, `html`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.
!bc
MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption
!ec

# latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies,
# or just plain \href{run: ...}{...}

MOVIE: [figs/mjolnir.mpeg, width=600 height=470]

#MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470]

#MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470]

The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the `movie15` package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable `MOVIE15`. There is an associated variable
`EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER` which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):
!bc sys
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc
!ec

The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
`myframes*.png`. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the `MOVIE:` command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



===== Copying Computer Code from Source Files =====

Another type of special lines starts with `@@@CODE` and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
Section ref{sec:verbatim:blocks} below.


===== Inline Tagging =====
label{inline:tagging}
idx{inline tagging} idx{emphasized words} idx{boldface words} idx{verbatim text}
idx{inline comments}

Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, _boldface phrases_,
and `verbatim text` (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in
!bc
*emphasized words*
!ec

Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:
!bc
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.
!ec
The line above gets typeset as
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between backquotes:
!bc
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.
!ec
The typesetting result looks like this:
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and `ptex2tex`) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing backquotes and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as
!bc
some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
!ec
which appears as some URL like "Search Google": "http://google.com".
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in `.txt`, `.html`, or `.pdf` follows the same
setup:
!bc
see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt"
!ec
which appears as see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt".

Links to files with other extensions must be realized
*with the filename as link text*, written as
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:
!bc
URL: "manual.xml"
!ec
# These work as well: "URL": "manual.xml" url: "manual.xml"
# "url":"manual.xml"
resulting in the link URL: "manual.xml".

To have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:
!bc
Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".
!ec
resulting in Click on this link: URL: "http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:
!bc
[name: comment]
!ec
where `name` is the name of the author of the command, and `comment` is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless `doconce format`
is run with a command-line specification of removing such comments
(see Chapter ref{doconce2formats} for an example). Inline comments
[hpl: Here is a specific example on an inline comment. It can
span several lines.]
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the `.do.txt` file
(see Chapter ref{doconce2formats}).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Most formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX (Epytext has some
inline math support that is utilized).  However, mathematical
expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains special formatting
commands, which may appear annoying in plain text. Doconce therefore
supports an extended inline math syntax where the writer can provide
an alternative syntax suited for formats close to plain ASCII:
!bc
Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.
!ec
That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in LaTeX, while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$, where $\bf A$|$A$
is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$
are vectors of length $n$|$n$."

===== Cross-Referencing =====
idx{cross referencing} idx{labels} idx{references}

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:
!bc
label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.
!ec
This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reStructuredText commands by `doconce format`. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure ref{fig:viz}
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to Sections ref{mathtext} and ref{newcommands} are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say (ref{my:eq1})--(ref{my:eq2}). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in Section ref{inline:tagging}.

===== Index and Bibliography =====
idx{index} idx{citations} idx{bibliography}

An index can be created for the LaTeX and the reStructuredText or
Sphinx formats by the `idx` keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:
!bc
idx{some index entry}
idx{main entry!subentry}
idx{`verbatim_text` and more}
!ec
The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to
!bc
\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}
!ec
Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: `idx`
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reStructuredText and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:
!bc
as found in cite{Larsen:86,Nielsen:99}.
!ec
Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding `cite` command; in reStructuredText
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like
!bc
as found in [3][14]
!ec
if `Larsen:86` has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and `Nielsen:99` is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword `BIBFILE:`,
which is optionally followed by a BibTeX file, having extension `.bib`,
a corresponding reStructuredText bibliography, having extension `.rst`,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension `.py`.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,
!bc
{
'Nielsen:99': """
K. Nielsen. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
""",
'Larsen:86':
"""
O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
*Personal Press*. 1986.
"""
}
!ec
In the LaTeX format, the `.bib` file will be used in the standard way,
in the reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the `.rst` file will be
copied into the document at the place where the `BIBFILE:` keyword
appears, while all other formats will make use of the Python dictionary
typeset as an ordered Doconce list, replacing the `BIBFILE:` line
in the document.

At present, only one file with bibliographic references can be used.

# see ketch/tex2rst for nice bibtex to rst converter which could
# be used here

Conversion of BibTeX databases to reStructuredText format can be
done by the "bibliograph.parsing":"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/" tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book cite{Python:Primer:09}, a paper cite{Osnes:98},
and both of them simultaneously cite{Python:Primer:09,Osnes:98}.

[somereader: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) ]


===== Tables =====

A table like

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--r--------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:
!bc
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
!ec
The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters `c`, `r`, or `l` to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes `|` can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (reStructuredText and Sphinx are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



===== Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code =====
label{sec:verbatim:blocks}

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" `!bc` keyword and an "end code" `!ec` keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  There may be an argument after the `!bc` tag to specify a
certain `ptex2tex` environment (for instance, `!bc dat` corresponds to
the data file environment in `ptex2tex`, and `!bc cod` is typically
used for a code snippet, but any argument can be defined). If there is
no argument, one assumes the ccq environment, which is plain LaTeX
verbatim in the default `.ptex2tex.cfg`. However, all these arguments
can be redefined in the `.ptex2tex.cfg` file.

The argument after `!bc` is also used
in a Sphinx context. Then argument is mapped onto a valid Pygments
language for typesetting of the verbatim block by Pygments. This
mapping takes place in an optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce
source file, e.g.,
!bc
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console
!ec
Here, three arguments are defined: `pycod` for Python code,
`cod` also for Python code, `cppcod` for C++ code, and `sys`
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in `.ptex2tex.cfg` for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, `pro` is used for complete programs in Python, `cod`
is for a code snippet in Python, while `xcod` and `xpro` implies
computer language specific typesetting where `x` can be
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, and `py` for Python.
The argument `sys` means by default `console` for Sphinx and
`CodeTerminal` (ptex2tex environent) for LaTeX. All these definitions
of the arguments after `!bc` can be redefined in the `.ptex2tex.cfg`
configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the `sphinx code-blocks`
comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages is easily added.

# (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code
# blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments
# and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the
# first one is used.)

The enclosing `!ec` tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (`pycod` style):
!bc pycod
# regular expressions for inline tags:
inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
INLINE_TAGS = {
    'emphasize':
    r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'verbatim':
    r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'bold':
    r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
}
!ec
And here is a C++ code snippet (`cppcod` style):
!bc cppcod
void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
        myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
    }
}
!ec

Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then
!bc
 @@@CODE myfile.f
 @@@CODE myfile.f fromto:subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1
!ec
The first line implies that all lines in the file `myfile.f` are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a `!bc pro` environment.  The
second line has a `fromto:' directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc cod`
environment. (The `pro` and `cod` arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain `!bc` environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
`@` sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching `subroutine test`
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching `C END1` (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):

@@@CODE __testcode.f

Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the `fromto:`
directive above:

@@@CODE __testcode.f fromto:subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

(Remark for those familiar with `ptex2tex`: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in `ptex2tex`. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
`.p.tex` file to be treated by `ptex2tex`. However, the `@@@CODE` line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by a *pro* or *cod* `ptex2tex`
environment.)


===== LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text =====
label{mathtext}

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is `!bt` (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
`!et`. It is important that `!bt` and `!et` appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.

Here is the result of a `!bt` - `!et` block:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f,\label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{eqnarray}
!et

This text looks ugly in all Doconce supported formats, except from
LaTeX and Sphinx.  If HTML is desired, the best is to filter the Doconce text
first to LaTeX and then use the widely available tex4ht tool to
convert the dvi file to HTML, or one could just link a PDF file (made
from LaTeX) directly from HTML. For other textual formats, it is best
to avoid blocks of mathematics and instead use inline mathematics
where it is possible to write expressions both in native LaTeX format
(so it looks good in LaTeX) and in a pure text format (so it looks
okay in other formats).

===== Macros (Newcommands) =====
label{newcommands}

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

__Example.__ Suppose we have the following commands in
`newcommand_replace.tex`:

@@@CODE newcommands_replace.tex

and these in `newcommands_keep.tex`:

@@@CODE newcommands_keep.tex

The LaTeX block
!bc
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep\label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
!ec
will then be rendered to
!bt
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep\label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
!et
in the current format.

===== Preprocessing Steps =====

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(URL:"http://code.google.com/p/preprocess") and mako
(URL:"http://www.makotemplates.org/"). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of `name=value` command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable `FORMAT`
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (`html`, `latex`,
`plain`, `rst`, `sphinx`, `epydoc`, `st`).  It is then easy to test on
the value of `FORMAT` and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example (see the Doconce
source code of this document to understand how preprocess is used to
create the example).

# If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated
# PostScript files are used.

# #if FORMAT == "latex"
# Use latex with subfigures (a) and (b)
\begin{figure}
label{fig:wavepackets}
  \begin{center}
#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0001.eps}}
#  #endif

#  #ifdef PNGFIGS
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.png}}
#  #else
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figs/wavepacket_0010.eps}}
#  #endif
  \end{center}
  \caption{
  Wavepackets at time (a) 0.1 s and (b) 0.2 s.
  }
\end{figure}

# #else

# Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.

# #endif

Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in Section ref{doconce2formats}.

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



===== Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces =====

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form `#include "file.do.txt"`.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reStructuredText and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate `.rst` files and an index file listing the various `.rst`
that build up the document. To generate the various `.rst` files one
should not run Doconce on the individual `.do.txt` files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script `doconce split_rst`
to split the long, complete `.rst` into pieces. This process requires
that each `#include "file.do.txt` line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax `#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>`, where
`file` is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword `part:`.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is `master.do.txt`.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run
!bc cod
doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake-sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi
!ec
The autogenerated `automake-sphinx.sh` file (by `doconce sphinx_dir`)
is compatible with a master `.rst` file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to `doconce sphinx_dir`.
This set is the output of `doconce split_rst`, which we catch in a
variable `files` above.


===== Missing Features =====

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, test on the
`FORMAT` variable (`#if FORMAT == "latex"`) in the Doconce code and
insert the table in LaTeX format. The `else` or `elif` branches may
have the table in other formats or a simplified version in the Doconce
table format. Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say
!bc
# table of contents
!ec
we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce `doconce format latex mydoc` to produce `mydoc.p.tex`. Then
we use the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst` commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:
!bc
Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
!ec
The `doconce replace from_text to_text filename` command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the `replace` method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with `\tableofcontents`, we should use `doconce subst`,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:
!bc
Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
!ec
Note the double backshlash in front of the `t` character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The `doconce subst` is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

===== Header and Footer =====

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if `TITLE:` or
`#TITLE:` is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


======= Troubleshooting =======

===== Disclaimer =====

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running `doconce format`, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


===== General Problems ======

=== Figure captions are incomplete ===

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

=== Preprocessor directives do not work ===

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

=== Problems with boldface and emphasize ===

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

=== Strange non-English characters ===

Check the encoding of the `.do.txt` file with the Unix `file` command
or with
!bc
Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
!ec
If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands
!bc
Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
!ec


===== Problems with Code or Tex Blocks =====

=== Code or TeX block errors in reST ===

Sometimes reStructuredText (reST) reports an "Unexpected indentation"
at the beginning of a code block. If you see a `!bc`, which should
have been removed by `doconce format`, it is usually an error in the
Doconce source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if
the line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a
question mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a
newline/space after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among
the mentioned. Then `!bc` will most likely be replaced and a double
colon at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in
reST to indicate a verbatim block of text).

=== Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST ===

If `idx` commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

=== Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly ===

Read the Section ref{sec:verbatim:blocks} above.  Start the
`!bc` and `!ec` tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

=== LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly ===

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the `!bt` and `!et` tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


===== Problems with reST Output ======

=== Lists do not appear in .rst files ===

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

=== Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST ===

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

=== Inconsistent headings in reST ===

The `rst2*.py` and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for `===`,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

===== Problems with LaTeX Output ======

=== The LaTeX file does not compile ===

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
!bc
\code{...}
!ec
the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in backquotes in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

===== Problems with gwiki Output ======

=== Strange nested lists in gwiki ===

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the `.gwiki` file directly.

=== Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source ===

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

===== Debugging =====

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
`_doconce_debugging.log`, if the to `doconce format` after the filename
is `debug`. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



======= Basic Parsing Ideas =======

# avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea)

The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression

!bc
(?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?
!ec

That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reStructuredText and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reStructuredText or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


===== A Glimpse of How to Write a New Translator =====

This is the HTML-specific part of the
source code of the HTML translator:
# #if FORMAT == "html"
(note that in HTML one of the the less-than and greater-than signs
in a link come up wrong because of the simple regex that is used
to substitute these pair of signs by special HTML expressions)
# #endif

# #if FORMAT != "epytext"

!bc
FILENAME_EXTENSION['html'] = '.html'  # output file extension
BLANKLINE['html'] = '<p>\n'           # blank input line => new paragraph
INLINE_TAGS_SUBST['html'] = {         # from inline tags to HTML tags
    # keep math as is:
    'math': None,  # indicates no substitution
    'emphasize':     r'\g<begin><em>\g<subst></em>\g<end>',
    'bold':          r'\g<begin><b>\g<subst></b>\g<end>',
    'verbatim':      r'\g<begin><tt>\g<subst></tt>\g<end>',
    'URL':           r'\g<begin><a href="\g<url>">\g<link></a>',
    'section':       r'<h1>\g<subst></h1>',
    'subsection':    r'<h3>\g<subst></h3>',
    'subsubsection': r'<h5>\g<subst></h5>',
    'paragraph':     r'<b>\g<subst></b>. ',
    'title':         r'<title>\g<subst></title>\n<center><h1>\g<subst></h1></center>',
    'date':          r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',
    'author':        r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',
    }

!ec

# #else
Note that for Epytext, code or LaTeX blocks that contain a newline
character (for example as in `\nabla` in LaTeX), will lead to an
effect of the newline and generate error messages. Our remedy is
to remove such code blocks and provide a notice about the removal.
Eight here we only displacy a smaller snippet that Epytext can
treat properly:

!bc
INLINE_TAGS_SUBST['html'] = {         # from inline tags to html tags
    # keep math as is:
    'math': None,  # indicates no substitution
    'emphasize':     r'\g<begin><em>\g<subst></em>\g<end>',
    'bold':          r'\g<begin><b>\g<subst></b>\g<end>',
    'verbatim':      r'\g<begin><tt>\g<subst></tt>\g<end>',
    'URL':           r'\g<begin><a href="\g<url>">\g<link></a>',
    }
!ec

# #endif

===== Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables =====

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that `argument`, `keyword argument`, `return`,
`instance variable`, `class variable`, and `module variable` are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.

!bc
    - argument x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
    - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
    - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
    - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
    - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
      (bool variable).
!ec

The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    - module variable x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - module variable tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

<H1>What Is Doconce? <A NAME="what:is:doconce"></A></H1>
<P>

<P>
Doconce is two things:

<P>

<OL>
 <LI> Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)
 <LI> Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".
</OL>

Here are some Doconce features:

<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown, Pandoc, and AsciiDoc, but less than reST, and very much
    less than LaTeX and HTML.
  <LI> Doconce can be converted to plain <EM>untagged</EM> text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  <LI> Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files.
  <LI> Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  <LI> Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  <LI> Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is a superior tool.
</UL>

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

<P>

<UL>
  <LI> Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, or MS Word.
    With <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex">ptex2tex</A>, Doconce can
    display computer code in LaTeX in many sophisticated ways (almost
    50 styles are available).
  <LI> Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  <LI> Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    MS Word documents, in wikis, or as Sphinx documents.
</UL>

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

<P>
Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting may face problems
when transformed to other formats.

<P>

<P>

<P>
<H3>Dependencies</H3>
<P>
If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess">Preprocess</A> or <A HREF="http://www.makotemplates.org">Mako</A> must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex">ptex2tex</A> and some style
files that <TT>ptex2tex</TT> potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires <A HREF="http://docutils.sourceforge.net">docutils</A>.  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course <A HREF="http://sphinx.pocoo.org">Sphinx</A>.
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to <A HREF="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</A> is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
docs/manual/manual.do.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
<A HREF="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html">demo web page</A>
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

<P>
The file <TT>make.sh</TT> in the same directory as the <TT>manual.do.txt</TT> file
(the current text) shows how to run <TT>doconce format</TT> on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

<P>
Another demo is found in
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
In the <TT>tutorial</TT> directory there is also a <TT>make.sh</TT> file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
<A HREF="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html">web demo</A>
of the results.

<P>
<!-- Example on including another Doconce file: -->

<H1>From Doconce to Other Formats <A NAME="doconce2formats"></A></H1>
<P>

<P>
Transformation of a Doconce document <TT>mydoc.do.txt</TT> to various other
formats applies the script <TT>doconce format</TT>:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
or just
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The <TT>mako</TT> or <TT>preprocess</TT> programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to <TT>mako</TT> or <TT>preprocess</TT> can be added after the
filename. For example,
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The variable <TT>FORMAT</TT> is always defined as the current format when
running <TT>preprocess</TT>. That is, in the last example, <TT>FORMAT</TT> is
defined as <TT>latex</TT>. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like <TT>#if FORMAT == "latex"</TT>.

<P>
Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

<P>

<P>
<H3>HTML</H3>
<P>
Making an HTML version of a Doconce file <TT>mydoc.do.txt</TT>
is performed by
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The resulting file <TT>mydoc.html</TT> can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

<P>
<H3>LaTeX</H3>
<P>
Making a LaTeX file <TT>mydoc.tex</TT> from <TT>mydoc.do.txt</TT> is done in two steps:
<!-- Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many -->
<!-- formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph -->
<!-- environment, as used here. -->

<P>
<B>Step 1.</B> Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form <TT>mydoc.p.tex</TT> for
     <TT>ptex2tex</TT>:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files <TT>newcommands.tex</TT>, <TT>newcommands_keep.tex</TT>, or
<TT>newcommands_replace.tex</TT> (see the section <A HREF="#newcommands">Macros (Newcommands)</a>).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

<P>
<B>Step 2.</B> Run <TT>ptex2tex</TT> (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
or just perform a plain copy,
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
Doconce generates a <TT>.p.tex</TT> file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
A separate titlepage can be generate by
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
The <TT>ptex2tex</TT> tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any <TT>!bc</TT> command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your <TT>.ptex2tex.cfg</TT>
file, e.g., <TT>!bc cod</TT> for a code snippet, where <TT>cod</TT> is set to
a certain environment in <TT>.ptex2tex.cfg</TT> (e.g., <TT>CodeIntended</TT>).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

<P>
<B>Step 3.</B> Compile <TT>mydoc.tex</TT>
and create the PDF file:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
If one wishes to use the <TT>Minted_Python</TT>, <TT>Minted_Cpp</TT>, etc., environments
in <TT>ptex2tex</TT> for typesetting code, the <TT>minted</TT> LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running <TT>doconce format</TT> with the
<TT>-DMINTED</TT> option:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
In this case, <TT>latex</TT> must be run with the
<TT>-shell-escape</TT> option:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The <TT>-shell-escape</TT> option is required because the <TT>minted.sty</TT> style
file runs the <TT>pygments</TT> program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from <TT>latex</TT> without the <TT>-shell-escape</TT> option.

<P>

<P>
<H3>Plain ASCII Text</H3>
<P>
We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
<H3>reStructuredText</H3>
<P>
Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file <TT>mydoc.rst</TT>:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
We may now produce various other formats:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The OpenOffice file <TT>mydoc.odt</TT> can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

<P>
<H3>Sphinx</H3>
<P>
Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the <TT>doconce sphinx_dir</TT> command:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The keywords <TT>author</TT>, <TT>title</TT>, and <TT>version</TT> are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, <TT>version</TT> is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files <TT>file1</TT>,
<TT>file2</TT>, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files <TT>file1</TT>, <TT>file2</TT>, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of <TT>dirname</TT> is <TT>sphinx-rootdir</TT>. The <TT>theme</TT>
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is <TT>'default'</TT>).

<P>
With a single-file document in <TT>mydoc.do.txt</TT> one often just runs
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory <TT>sphinx-rootdir</TT> is made with
relevant files.

<P>
The <TT>doconce sphinx_dir</TT> command generates a script
<TT>automake-sphinx.sh</TT> for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named <TT>figs</TT> or <TT>figures</TT>
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, <TT>automake-sphinx.sh</TT> must be edited accordingly. One
can either run <TT>automake-sphinx.sh</TT> or perform the steps in the
script manually.

<P>
Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the <TT>conf.py</TT>
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
<TT>make-themes.sh</TT> can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes <TT>fenics</TT> and <TT>pyramid</TT>, one writes
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The resulting directories with HTML documents are <TT>_build/html_fenics</TT>
and <TT>_build/html_pyramid</TT>, respectively. Without arguments,
<TT>make-themes.sh</TT> makes all available themes (!).

<P>
If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file <TT>mydoc.do.txt</TT>.

<P>
<B>Step 1.</B> Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
<B>Step 2.</B> Create a Sphinx root directory with a <TT>conf.py</TT> file,
either manually or by using the interactive <TT>sphinx-quickstart</TT>
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
<B>Step 3.</B> Copy the <TT>tutorial.rst</TT> file to the Sphinx root directory:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with <TT>mydoc.rst</TT> in the <TT>sphinx-rootdir</TT>
directory. Either edit <TT>mydoc.rst</TT> so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to <TT>sphinx-rootdir</TT>.

<P>
<B>Step 4.</B> Edit the generated <TT>index.rst</TT> file so that <TT>mydoc.rst</TT>
is included, i.e., add <TT>mydoc</TT> to the <TT>toctree</TT> section so that it becomes
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
(The spaces before <TT>mydoc</TT> are important!)

<P>
<B>Step 5.</B> Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
<B>Step 6.</B> View the result:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows <TT>!bc</TT>: <TT>cod</TT> gives Python
(<TT>code-block:: python</TT> in Sphinx syntax) and <TT>cppcod</TT> gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

<P>

<P>
<H3>Google Code Wiki</H3>
<P>
There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax">Google Code</A>.
The transformation to this format, called <TT>gwiki</TT> to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the <TT>mydoc.gwiki</TT> output file from <TT>doconce format</TT> and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press <B>Preview</B> or <B>Save Page</B> to
see the formatted result.

<P>
When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).

<P>

<P>
<H3>Tweaking the Doconce Output</H3>
<P>
Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
<TT>.rst</TT> file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if <TT>.eps</TT> or <TT>.png</TT> is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The <TT>make.sh</TT> files in <TT>docs/manual</TT> and <TT>docs/tutorial</TT>
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.

<P>

<P>

<P>
<H1>The Doconce Markup Language</H1>
<P>
The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

<P>
<H3>Lists</H3>
<P>
An unordered bullet list makes use of the <TT>*</TT> as bullet sign
and is indented as follows

<P>
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
This list gets typeset as

<P>

<UL>
   <LI> item 1
   <LI> item 2

<UL>
     <LI> subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here
     <LI> subitem 2,
       also spans two lines
</UL>

   <LI> item 3
</UL>

In an ordered list, each item starts with an <TT>o</TT> (as the first letter
in "ordered"):

<P>
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
resulting in

<P>

<OL>
  <LI> item 1
  <LI> item 2

<UL>
     <LI> subitem 1
     <LI> subitem 2
</UL>

  <LI> item 3
</OL>

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

<P>
In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:

<P>
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple lines)
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
The result becomes

<P>

<DL>
   <DT>keyword1:<DD> 
     explanation of keyword1
   <DT>keyword2:<DD> 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple lines)
</DL>
<H3>Special Lines</H3>
<P>
The Doconce markup language has a concept called <EM>special lines</EM>.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.

<P>

<P>
<B>Heading with Title and Author(s).</B> Lines starting with <TT>TITLE:</TT>, <TT>AUTHOR:</TT>, and <TT>DATE:</TT> are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The <TT>at</TT> with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the <TT>and</TT> with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
Multiple authors require multiple <TT>AUTHOR:</TT> lines. All information
associated with <TT>TITLE:</TT> and <TT>AUTHOR:</TT> keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: November 9, 2016
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
Note the how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including reStructuredText and Sphinx)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

[3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.

<P>

<P>
<B>Section Headings.</B> Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

<P>

<UL>
   <LI> 7 underscores or equal signs for sections
   <LI> 5 for subsections
   <LI> 3 for subsubsections
   <LI> 2 underscrores (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)
</UL>

Headings can be surrounded by blanks if desired.

<P>
Here are some examples:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.

      ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
The running text goes here.

          ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
The result for the present format looks like this:

<P>
<H1>Example on a Section Heading</H1>
<P>
The running text goes here.

<P>
<H3>Example on a Subsection Heading</H3>
The running text goes here.

<P>
<H4>Example on a Subsubsection Heading</H4>
<P>
The running text goes here.

<P>
<B>A Paragraph.</B> The running text goes here.

<P>
<H1>Special Lines</H1>
<P>
<H3>Figures</H3>
<P>
Figures are recognized by the special line syntax
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say <TT>.eps</TT> when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's <TT>convert</TT> utility).

<P>
The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

<P>
Note also that, like for <TT>TITLE:</TT> and <TT>AUTHOR:</TT> lines, all information
related to a figure line must be written on the same line. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as <TT>FIGURE:</TT> will be
included in the formatted caption).

<P>
<IMG SRC="figs/streamtubes.png" ALIGN="bottom"  width=400> <P><EM> Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. <A NAME="fig:viz"></A></EM></P>

<P>
<H3>Movies</H3>
<P>
Here is an example on the <TT>MOVIE:</TT> keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the <TT>latex</TT>, <TT>html</TT>, <TT>rst</TT>, and <TT>sphinx</TT> formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
<!-- latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies, -->
<!-- or just plain \h<A HREF="#run: ...">run: ...</a>{...} -->

<P>

<EMBED SRC="figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=600 height=470 AUTOPLAY="TRUE" LOOP="TRUE"></EMBED>
<P>
<EM></EM>
</P>


<P>
<!-- MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470] -->

<P>
<!-- MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470] -->

<P>
The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

<P>
When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the <TT>movie15</TT> package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable <TT>MOVIE15</TT>. There is an associated variable
<TT>EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER</TT> which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   sys-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
<TT>myframes*.png</TT>. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

<P>
Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the <TT>MOVIE:</TT> command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).

<P>

<P>

<P>
<H3>Copying Computer Code from Source Files</H3>
<P>
Another type of special lines starts with <TT>@@@CODE</TT> and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section <A HREF="#sec:verbatim:blocks">Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code</a> below.

<P>

<P>
<H3>Inline Tagging <A NAME="inline:tagging"></A></H3>
<P>

<P>
Doconce supports tags for <EM>emphasized phrases</EM>, <B>boldface phrases</B>,
and <TT>verbatim text</TT> (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x).

<P>
Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
*emphasized words*
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The line above gets typeset as
<B>several words in boldface</B> followed by <EM>ephasized text</EM>.

<P>
Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between backquotes:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The typesetting result looks like this:
<TT>call myroutine(a, b)</TT> looks like a Fortran call
while <TT>void myfunc(double *a, double *b)</TT> must be C.

<P>
It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and <TT>ptex2tex</TT>) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

<P>
Watch out for mixing backquotes and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

<P>
Web addresses with links are typeset as
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
which appears as some URL like <A HREF="http://google.com">Search Google</A>.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in <TT>.txt</TT>, <TT>.html</TT>, or <TT>.pdf</TT> follows the same
setup:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt"
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
which appears as see the <A HREF="manual.do.txt">Doconce Manual</A>.

<P>
Links to files with other extensions must be realized
<EM>with the filename as link text</EM>, written as
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
URL: "manual.xml"
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
<!-- These work as well: <A HREF="manual.xml"><TT>manual.xml</TT></A> <A HREF="manual.xml"><TT>manual.xml</TT></A> -->
<!-- <A HREF="manual.xml"><TT>manual.xml</TT></A> -->
resulting in the link <A HREF="manual.xml"><TT>manual.xml</TT></A>.

<P>
To have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
resulting in Click on this link: <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/doconce"><TT>http://code.google.com/p/doconce</TT></A>.

<P>
Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[name: comment]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
where <TT>name</TT> is the name of the author of the command, and <TT>comment</TT> is a
plain text text. [<B>hpl</B>: <EM>Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized.</EM>]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless <TT>doconce format</TT>
is run with a command-line specification of removing such comments
(see the chapter <A HREF="#doconce2formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</a> for an example). Inline comments
[<B>hpl</B>: <EM>Here is a specific example on an inline comment. It can
span several lines.</EM>]
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the <TT>.do.txt</TT> file
(see the chapter <A HREF="#doconce2formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</a>).

<P>
Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Most formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX (Epytext has some
inline math support that is utilized).  However, mathematical
expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains special formatting
commands, which may appear annoying in plain text. Doconce therefore
supports an extended inline math syntax where the writer can provide
an alternative syntax suited for formats close to plain ASCII:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in LaTeX, while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system Ax=b, where A
is an nxn matrix, and x and b
are vectors of length n."

<P>
<H3>Cross-Referencing</H3>
<P>
References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reStructuredText commands by <TT>doconce format</TT>. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

<P>
It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure <A HREF="#fig:viz">fig:viz</a>
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections <A HREF="#mathtext">LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text</a> and <A HREF="#newcommands">Macros (Newcommands)</a> are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say (<A HREF="#my:eq1">my:eq1</a>)--(<A HREF="#my:eq2">my:eq2</a>). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

<P>
Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section <A HREF="#inline:tagging">Inline Tagging</a>.

<P>
<H3>Index and Bibliography</H3>
<P>
An index can be created for the LaTeX and the reStructuredText or
Sphinx formats by the <TT>idx</TT> keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
idx{some index entry}
idx{main entry!subentry}
idx{`verbatim_text` and more}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: <TT>idx</TT>
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reStructuredText and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

<P>
Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
as found in cite{Larsen:86,Nielsen:99}.
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding <TT>cite</TT> command; in reStructuredText
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
as found in [3][14]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
if <TT>Larsen:86</TT> has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and <TT>Nielsen:99</TT> is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

<P>
The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword <TT>BIBFILE:</TT>,
which is optionally followed by a BibTeX file, having extension <TT>.bib</TT>,
a corresponding reStructuredText bibliography, having extension <TT>.rst</TT>,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension <TT>.py</TT>.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
{
'Nielsen:99': """
K. Nielsen. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.

*Personal Press*. 1986.
"""
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
In the LaTeX format, the <TT>.bib</TT> file will be used in the standard way,
in the reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the <TT>.rst</TT> file will be
copied into the document at the place where the <TT>BIBFILE:</TT> keyword
appears, while all other formats will make use of the Python dictionary
typeset as an ordered Doconce list, replacing the <TT>BIBFILE:</TT> line
in the document.

<P>
At present, only one file with bibliographic references can be used.

<P>
<!-- see ketch/tex2rst for nice bibtex to rst converter which could -->
<!-- be used here -->

<P>
Conversion of BibTeX databases to reStructuredText format can be
done by the <A HREF="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/">bibliograph.parsing</A> tool.

<P>
Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book <A HREF="#Python:Primer:09">[1]</A>, a paper <A HREF="#Osnes:98">[2]</A>,
and both of them simultaneously <A HREF="#Python:Primer:09">[1]</A> <A HREF="#Osnes:98">[2]</A>.

<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters <TT>c</TT>, <TT>r</TT>, or <TT>l</TT> to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes <TT>|</TT> can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (reStructuredText and Sphinx are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.

<P>

<P>

<P>
<H3>Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code <A NAME="sec:verbatim:blocks"></A></H3>
<P>

<P>
Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" <TT>!bc</TT> keyword and an "end code" <TT>!ec</TT> keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and <EM>start at the beginning of the
line</EM>.  There may be an argument after the <TT>!bc</TT> tag to specify a
certain <TT>ptex2tex</TT> environment (for instance, <TT>!bc dat</TT> corresponds to
the data file environment in <TT>ptex2tex</TT>, and <TT>!bc cod</TT> is typically
used for a code snippet, but any argument can be defined). If there is
no argument, one assumes the ccq environment, which is plain LaTeX
verbatim in the default <TT>.ptex2tex.cfg</TT>. However, all these arguments
can be redefined in the <TT>.ptex2tex.cfg</TT> file.

<P>
The argument after <TT>!bc</TT> is also used
in a Sphinx context. Then argument is mapped onto a valid Pygments
language for typesetting of the verbatim block by Pygments. This
mapping takes place in an optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce
source file, e.g.,
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
Here, three arguments are defined: <TT>pycod</TT> for Python code,
<TT>cod</TT> also for Python code, <TT>cppcod</TT> for C++ code, and <TT>sys</TT>
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in <TT>.ptex2tex.cfg</TT> for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

<P>
By default, <TT>pro</TT> is used for complete programs in Python, <TT>cod</TT>
is for a code snippet in Python, while <TT>xcod</TT> and <TT>xpro</TT> implies
computer language specific typesetting where <TT>x</TT> can be
<TT>f</TT> for Fortran, <TT>c</TT> for C, <TT>cpp</TT> for C++, and <TT>py</TT> for Python.
The argument <TT>sys</TT> means by default <TT>console</TT> for Sphinx and
<TT>CodeTerminal</TT> (ptex2tex environent) for LaTeX. All these definitions
of the arguments after <TT>!bc</TT> can be redefined in the <TT>.ptex2tex.cfg</TT>
configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the <TT>sphinx code-blocks</TT>
comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages is easily added.

<P>
<!-- (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code -->
<!-- blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments -->
<!-- and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the -->
<!-- first one is used.) -->

<P>
The enclosing <TT>!ec</TT> tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

<P>
Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (<TT>pycod</TT> style):

Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax

</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The first line implies that all lines in the file <TT>myfile.f</TT> are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a <TT>!bc pro</TT> environment.  The
second line has a `fromto:' directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc cod`
environment. (The <TT>pro</TT> and <TT>cod</TT> arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain <TT>!bc</TT> environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
<TT>@</TT> sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching <TT>subroutine test</TT>
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching <TT>C END1</TT> (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

<P>
Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):

(Remark for those familiar with <TT>ptex2tex</TT>: The from-to

<H3>LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text <A NAME="mathtext"></A></H3>

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is <TT>!bt</TT> (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
<TT>!et</TT>. It is important that <TT>!bt</TT> and <TT>!et</TT> appear on the beginning of the

\end{eqnarray}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This text looks ugly in all Doconce supported formats, except from
LaTeX and Sphinx.  If HTML is desired, the best is to filter the Doconce text
first to LaTeX and then use the widely available tex4ht tool to
convert the dvi file to HTML, or one could just link a PDF file (made
from LaTeX) directly from HTML. For other textual formats, it is best
to avoid blocks of mathematics and instead use inline mathematics
where it is possible to write expressions both in native LaTeX format
(so it looks good in LaTeX) and in a pure text format (so it looks
okay in other formats).

<P>
<H3>Macros (Newcommands) <A NAME="newcommands"></A></H3>
<P>

<P>
Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style <EM>newcommand</EM>
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
<TT>newcommand_replace.tex</TT> are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names <TT>newcommands.tex</TT> and
<TT>newcommands_keep.tex</TT> are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
<TT>!bt</TT> and <TT>!et</TT> in <TT>newcommands_keep.tex</TT> to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
<TT>newcommands_replace.tex</TT> and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the <TT>newcommands*.tex</TT> files <EM>must</EM> appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

<P>
<B>Example.</B> Suppose we have the following commands in
<TT>newcommand_replace.tex</TT>:

<P>
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->

in the current format.

<P>
<H3>Preprocessing Steps</H3>
<P>
Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess"><TT>http://code.google.com/p/preprocess</TT></A>) and mako
(<A HREF="http://www.makotemplates.org/"><TT>http://www.makotemplates.org/</TT></A>). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of <TT>name=value</TT> command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

<P>
Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

<P>
The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable <TT>FORMAT</TT>
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (<TT>html</TT>, <TT>latex</TT>,
<TT>plain</TT>, <TT>rst</TT>, <TT>sphinx</TT>, <TT>epydoc</TT>, <TT>st</TT>).  It is then easy to test on
the value of <TT>FORMAT</TT> and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example (see the Doconce
source code of this document to understand how preprocess is used to
create the example).

<P>
<!-- If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated -->
<!-- PostScript files are used. -->

<P>

<P>
<!-- Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats -->

<P>
<IMG SRC="figs/wavepacket_0001.png" ALIGN="bottom"  width=400> <P><EM> Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.</EM></P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section <A HREF="#doconce2formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</a>.

<P>
More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.

<P>

<P>

<P>
<H3>Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces</H3>
<P>
Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form <TT>#include "file.do.txt"</TT>.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

<P>
For reStructuredText and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate <TT>.rst</TT> files and an index file listing the various <TT>.rst</TT>
that build up the document. To generate the various <TT>.rst</TT> files one
should not run Doconce on the individual <TT>.do.txt</TT> files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script <TT>doconce split_rst</TT>
to split the long, complete <TT>.rst</TT> into pieces. This process requires
that each <TT>#include "file.do.txt</TT> line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax <TT>#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>></TT>, where
<TT>file</TT> is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword <TT>part:</TT>.

<P>
Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is <TT>master.do.txt</TT>.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK   cod-->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake-sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The autogenerated <TT>automake-sphinx.sh</TT> file (by <TT>doconce sphinx_dir</TT>)
is compatible with a master <TT>.rst</TT> file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to <TT>doconce sphinx_dir</TT>.
This set is the output of <TT>doconce split_rst</TT>, which we catch in a
variable <TT>files</TT> above.

<P>

<P>
<H3>Missing Features</H3>
<P>
Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, test on the
<TT>FORMAT</TT> variable (<TT>#if FORMAT == "latex"</TT>) in the Doconce code and
insert the table in LaTeX format. The <TT>else</TT> or <TT>elif</TT> branches may
have the table in other formats or a simplified version in the Doconce
table format. Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

<P>
Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

<P>
As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
# table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce <TT>doconce format latex mydoc</TT> to produce <TT>mydoc.p.tex</TT>. Then
we use the <TT>doconce replace</TT> and <TT>doconce subst</TT> commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
The <TT>doconce replace from_text to_text filename</TT> command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the <TT>replace</TT> method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with <TT>\tableofcontents</TT>, we should use <TT>doconce subst</TT>,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
Note the double backshlash in front of the <TT>t</TT> character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The <TT>doconce subst</TT> is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

<P>
<H3>Header and Footer</H3>
<P>
Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if <TT>TITLE:</TT> or
<TT>#TITLE:</TT> is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.

<P>

<P>
<H1>Troubleshooting</H1>
<P>
<H3>Disclaimer</H3>
<P>
Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running <TT>doconce format</TT>, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

<P>
However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.

<P>

<P>
<H3>General Problems</H3>
<P>
<H4>Figure captions are incomplete</H4>
<P>
If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as <EM>one line</EM>, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

<P>
<H4>Preprocessor directives do not work</H4>
<P>
Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

<P>
<H4>Problems with boldface and emphasize</H4>
<P>
Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

<P>
<H4>Strange non-English characters</H4>
<P>
Check the encoding of the <TT>.do.txt</TT> file with the Unix <TT>file</TT> command
or with
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>

<P>
<H3>Problems with Code or Tex Blocks</H3>
<P>
<H4>Code or TeX block errors in reST</H4>
<P>
Sometimes reStructuredText (reST) reports an "Unexpected indentation"
at the beginning of a code block. If you see a <TT>!bc</TT>, which should
have been removed by <TT>doconce format</TT>, it is usually an error in the
Doconce source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if
the line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a
question mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a
newline/space after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among
the mentioned. Then <TT>!bc</TT> will most likely be replaced and a double
colon at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in
reST to indicate a verbatim block of text).

<P>
<H4>Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST</H4>
<P>
If <TT>idx</TT> commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

<P>
<H4>Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly</H4>
<P>
Read the the section <A HREF="#sec:verbatim:blocks">Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code</a> above.  Start the
<TT>!bc</TT> and <TT>!ec</TT> tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

<P>
<H4>LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly</H4>
<P>
Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the <TT>!bt</TT> and <TT>!et</TT> tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.

<P>

<P>
<H3>Problems with reST Output</H3>
<P>
<H4>Lists do not appear in .rst files</H4>
<P>
Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

<P>
<H4>Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST</H4>
<P>
This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

<P>
<H4>Inconsistent headings in reST</H4>
<P>
The <TT>rst2*.py</TT> and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for <TT>===</TT>,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

<P>
<H3>Problems with LaTeX Output</H3>
<P>
<H4>The LaTeX file does not compile</H4>
<P>
If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
\code{...}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->
the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in backquotes in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

<P>
<H3>Problems with gwiki Output</H3>
<P>
<H4>Strange nested lists in gwiki</H4>
<P>
Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the <TT>.gwiki</TT> file directly.

<P>
<H4>Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source</H4>
<P>
Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

<P>
<H3>Debugging</H3>
<P>
Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
<TT>_doconce_debugging.log</TT>, if the to <TT>doconce format</TT> after the filename
is <TT>debug</TT>. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.

<P>

<P>

<P>
<H1>Basic Parsing Ideas</H1>
<P>
<!-- avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea) -->

<P>
The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

<P>
All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

<P>
The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression

<P>
<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK  -->
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
(?P&lt;indent&gt; *(?P&lt;listtype&gt;[*o-] )? *)(?P&lt;keyword&gt;[^:]+?:)?(?P&lt;text&gt;.*)\s?
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->

<P>
That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

<P>
When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

<P>
The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

<P>
It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reStructuredText and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reStructuredText or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.

<P>

<P>
<H3>A Glimpse of How to Write a New Translator</H3>
<P>
This is the HTML-specific part of the
source code of the HTML translator:
(note that in HTML one of the the less-than and greater-than signs
in a link come up wrong because of the simple regex that is used
to substitute these pair of signs by special HTML expressions)

<H3>Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables</H3>
<P>
As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and <EM>placed at the end of
the doc string</EM>. Note that <TT>argument</TT>, <TT>keyword argument</TT>, <TT>return</TT>,
<TT>instance variable</TT>, <TT>class variable</TT>, and <TT>module variable</TT> are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.

Doconce Description
===================

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen

:Date: Nov 23, 2011

.. lines beginning with # are comment lines



.. _what:is:doconce:

What Is Doconce?
================

Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown, Pandoc, and AsciiDoc, but less than reST, and very much
    less than LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, or MS Word.
    With `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_, Doconce can
    display computer code in LaTeX in many sophisticated ways (almost
    50 styles are available).

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    MS Word documents, in wikis, or as Sphinx documents.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting may face problems
when transformed to other formats.



Dependencies
------------

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either `Preprocess <http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_ or `Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org>`_ must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_ and some style
files that ``ptex2tex`` potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_.  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_.
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

Demos
-----


The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the::


        docs/manual/manual.do.txt

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
`demo web page <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>`_
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file ``make.sh`` in the same directory as the ``manual.do.txt`` file
(the current text) shows how to run ``doconce format`` on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

In the ``tutorial`` directory there is also a ``make.sh`` file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
`web demo <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>`_
of the results.

.. Example on including another Doconce file:



.. _doconce2formats:

From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document ``mydoc.do.txt`` to various other
formats applies the script ``doconce format``::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable ``FORMAT`` is always defined as the current format when
running ``preprocess``. That is, in the last example, ``FORMAT`` is
defined as ``latex``. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like ``#if FORMAT == "latex"``.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file ``mydoc.html`` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file ``mydoc.tex`` from ``mydoc.do.txt`` is done in two steps:
.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many

.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph

.. environment, as used here.


*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form ``mydoc.p.tex`` for
     ``ptex2tex``::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files ``newcommands.tex``, ``newcommands_keep.tex``, or
``newcommands_replace.tex`` (see the section `Macros (Newcommands)`_).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ``ptex2tex`` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a ``.p.tex`` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc

A separate titlepage can be generate by::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc


The ``ptex2tex`` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any ``!bc`` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
file, e.g., ``!bc cod`` for a code snippet, where ``cod`` is set to
a certain environment in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` (e.g., ``CodeIntended``).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

*Step 3.* Compile ``mydoc.tex``
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the ``Minted_Python``, ``Minted_Cpp``, etc., environments
in ``ptex2tex`` for typesetting code, the ``minted`` LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running ``doconce format`` with the
``-DMINTED`` option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, ``latex`` must be run with the
``-shell-escape`` option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

The ``-shell-escape`` option is required because the ``minted.sty`` style
file runs the ``pygments`` program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from ``latex`` without the ``-shell-escape`` option.


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file ``mydoc.rst``::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file ``mydoc.odt`` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords ``author``, ``title``, and ``version`` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, ``version`` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files ``file1``,
``file2``, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files ``file1``, ``file2``, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of ``dirname`` is ``sphinx-rootdir``. The ``theme``
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ``'default'``).

With a single-file document in ``mydoc.do.txt`` one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory ``sphinx-rootdir`` is made with
relevant files.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command generates a script
``automake-sphinx.sh`` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named ``figs`` or ``figures``
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, ``automake-sphinx.sh`` must be edited accordingly. One
can either run ``automake-sphinx.sh`` or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the ``conf.py``
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
``make-themes.sh`` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes ``fenics`` and ``pyramid``, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are ``_build/html_fenics``
and ``_build/html_pyramid``, respectively. Without arguments,
``make-themes.sh`` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file ``mydoc.do.txt``.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory with a ``conf.py`` file,
either manually or by using the interactive ``sphinx-quickstart``
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


*Step 3.* Copy the ``tutorial.rst`` file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with ``mydoc.rst`` in the ``sphinx-rootdir``
directory. Either edit ``mydoc.rst`` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to ``sphinx-rootdir``.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated ``index.rst`` file so that ``mydoc.rst``
is included, i.e., add ``mydoc`` to the ``toctree`` section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before ``mydoc`` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows ``!bc``: ``cod`` gives Python
(``code-block:: python`` in Sphinx syntax) and ``cppcod`` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Google Code Wiki
----------------

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by `Google Code <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_.
The transformation to this format, called ``gwiki`` to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the ``mydoc.gwiki`` output file from ``doconce format`` and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press **Preview** or **Save Page** to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
``.rst`` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if ``.eps`` or ``.png`` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The ``make.sh`` files in ``docs/manual`` and ``docs/tutorial``
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



The Doconce Markup Language
===========================

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

Lists
-----

An unordered bullet list makes use of the ``*`` as bullet sign
and is indented as follows::


           * item 1
        
           * item 2
        
             * subitem 1, if there are more
               lines, each line must
               be intended as shown here
        
             * subitem 2,
               also spans two lines
        
           * item 3


This list gets typeset as

   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines


   * item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an ``o`` (as the first letter
in "ordered")::


           o item 1
        
           o item 2
        
             * subitem 1
        
             * subitem 2
        
           o item 3


resulting in

  1. item 1

  2. item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2


  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon::


           - keyword1: explanation of keyword1
        
           - keyword2: explanation
             of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
             if there are multiple lines)


The result becomes

   keyword1: 
     explanation of keyword1

   keyword2: 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple lines)

Special Lines
-------------

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with ``TITLE:``, ``AUTHOR:``, and ``DATE:`` are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax::


        name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3

The ``at`` with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the ``and`` with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
Multiple authors require multiple ``AUTHOR:`` lines. All information
associated with ``TITLE:`` and ``AUTHOR:`` keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: November 9, 2016

Note the how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including reStructuredText and Sphinx)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format::


        Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
        Kaare Dump [3]
        A. Dummy Author
        
        [1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
        [2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
        [3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   * 7 underscores or equal signs for sections

   * 5 for subsections

   * 3 for subsubsections

   * 2 underscrores (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by blanks if desired.

Here are some examples::


        ======= Example on a Section Heading =======
        
        The running text goes here.
        
              ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
        The running text goes here.
        
                  ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        __A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.


The result for the present format looks like this:

Example on a Section Heading
============================

The running text goes here.

Example on a Subsection Heading
-------------------------------
The running text goes here.

Example on a Subsubsection Heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The running text goes here.

*A Paragraph.* The running text goes here.

Special Lines
=============

Figures
-------

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax::


        FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say ``.eps`` when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's ``convert`` utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for ``TITLE:`` and ``AUTHOR:`` lines, all information
related to a figure line must be written on the same line. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as ``FIGURE:`` will be
included in the formatted caption).


.. _fig:viz:

.. figure:: figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 400

   Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow  (fig:viz)


Movies
------

Here is an example on the ``MOVIE:`` keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the ``latex``, ``html``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie::


        MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption


.. latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies,

.. or just plain \h`run: ...`_{...}


.. raw:: html
        
        <EMBED SRC="figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=600 height=470 AUTOPLAY="TRUE" LOOP="TRUE"></EMBED>
        <P>
        <EM></EM>
        </P>



.. MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470]


.. MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470]


The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the ``movie15`` package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable ``MOVIE15``. There is an associated variable
``EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER`` which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader)::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc


The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
``myframes*.png``. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the ``MOVIE:`` command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



Copying Computer Code from Source Files
---------------------------------------

Another type of special lines starts with ``@@@CODE`` and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section `Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code`_ below.


.. _inline:tagging:

Inline Tagging
--------------

Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, **boldface phrases**,
and ``verbatim text`` (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x).

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in::


        *emphasized words*


Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk::


        _several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

The line above gets typeset as
**several words in boldface** followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between backquotes::


        `call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
        while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

The typesetting result looks like this:
``call myroutine(a, b)`` looks like a Fortran call
while ``void myfunc(double *a, double *b)`` must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and ``ptex2tex``) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing backquotes and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as::


        some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"

which appears as some URL like `Search Google <http://google.com>`_.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in ``.txt``, ``.html``, or ``.pdf`` follows the same
setup::


        see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt"

which appears as see the `Doconce Manual <manual.do.txt>`_.

Links to files with other extensions must be realized
*with the filename as link text*, written as
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes::


        URL: "manual.xml"

.. These work as well: `<manual.xml>`_ `<manual.xml>`_

.. `<manual.xml>`_

resulting in the link `<manual.xml>`_.

To have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes::


        Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

resulting in Click on this link: `<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>`_.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text::


        [name: comment]

where ``name`` is the name of the author of the command, and ``comment`` is a
plain text text. (**hpl**: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized.)
The name and comment are visible in the output unless ``doconce format``
is run with a command-line specification of removing such comments
(see the chapter `From Doconce to Other Formats`_ for an example). Inline comments
(**hpl**: Here is a specific example on an inline comment. It can
span several lines.)
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the ``.do.txt`` file
(see the chapter `From Doconce to Other Formats`_).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Most formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX (Epytext has some
inline math support that is utilized).  However, mathematical
expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains special formatting
commands, which may appear annoying in plain text. Doconce therefore
supports an extended inline math syntax where the writer can provide
an alternative syntax suited for formats close to plain ASCII::


        Here is an example on a linear system
        ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
        where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
        $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in LaTeX, while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system Ax=b, where A
is an nxn matrix, and x and b
are vectors of length n."

Cross-Referencing
-----------------

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple::


        label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
        For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reStructuredText commands by ``doconce format``. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure `fig:viz`_
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections `LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text`_ and `Macros (Newcommands)`_ are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section `Inline Tagging`_.

Index and Bibliography
----------------------

An index can be created for the LaTeX and the reStructuredText or
Sphinx formats by the ``idx`` keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax::


        idx{some index entry}
        idx{main entry!subentry}
        idx{`verbatim_text` and more}

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to::


        \index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: ``idx``
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reStructuredText and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style::


        as found in cite{Larsen:86,Nielsen:99}.

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding ``cite`` command; in reStructuredText
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like::


        as found in [3][14]

if ``Larsen:86`` has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and ``Nielsen:99`` is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword ``BIBFILE:``,
which is optionally followed by a BibTeX file, having extension ``.bib``,
a corresponding reStructuredText bibliography, having extension ``.rst``,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension ``.py``.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.::


        {
        'Nielsen:99': """
        K. Nielsen. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
        URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
        """,
        'Larsen:86':
        """
        O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
        *Personal Press*. 1986.
        """
        }

In the LaTeX format, the ``.bib`` file will be used in the standard way,
in the reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the ``.rst`` file will be
copied into the document at the place where the ``BIBFILE:`` keyword
appears, while all other formats will make use of the Python dictionary
typeset as an ordered Doconce list, replacing the ``BIBFILE:`` line
in the document.

At present, only one file with bibliographic references can be used.

Tables
------

A table like

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters ``c``, ``r``, or ``l`` to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes ``|`` can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (reStructuredText and Sphinx are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



.. _sec:verbatim:blocks:

Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code
--------------------------------

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" ``!bc`` keyword and an "end code" ``!ec`` keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  There may be an argument after the ``!bc`` tag to specify a
certain ``ptex2tex`` environment (for instance, ``!bc dat`` corresponds to
the data file environment in ``ptex2tex``, and ``!bc cod`` is typically
used for a code snippet, but any argument can be defined). If there is
no argument, one assumes the ccq environment, which is plain LaTeX
verbatim in the default ``.ptex2tex.cfg``. However, all these arguments
can be redefined in the ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` file.

The argument after ``!bc`` is also used
in a Sphinx context. Then argument is mapped onto a valid Pygments
language for typesetting of the verbatim block by Pygments. This
mapping takes place in an optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce
source file, e.g.::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

Here, three arguments are defined: ``pycod`` for Python code,
``cod`` also for Python code, ``cppcod`` for C++ code, and ``sys``
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, ``pro`` is used for complete programs in Python, ``cod``
is for a code snippet in Python, while ``xcod`` and ``xpro`` implies
computer language specific typesetting where ``x`` can be
``f`` for Fortran, ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++, and ``py`` for Python.
The argument ``sys`` means by default ``console`` for Sphinx and
``CodeTerminal`` (ptex2tex environent) for LaTeX. All these definitions
of the arguments after ``!bc`` can be redefined in the ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the ``sphinx code-blocks``
comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages is easily added.

.. (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code

.. blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments

.. and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the

.. first one is used.)


The enclosing ``!ec`` tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (``pycod`` style)::


        # regular expressions for inline tags:
        inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
        inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
        INLINE_TAGS = {
            'emphasize':
            r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'verbatim':
            r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'bold':
            r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
        }

And here is a C++ code snippet (``cppcod`` style)::


        void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
            for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
                myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
            }
        }


Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then::


         @@@CODE myfile.f
         @@@CODE myfile.f fromto:subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

The first line implies that all lines in the file ``myfile.f`` are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a ``!bc pro`` environment.  The
second line has a `fromto:' directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc cod`
environment. (The ``pro`` and ``cod`` arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain ``!bc`` environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
``@`` sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching ``subroutine test``
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching ``C END1`` (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above)::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the ``fromto:``
directive above::


              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        


(Remark for those familiar with ``ptex2tex``: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in ``ptex2tex``. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
``.p.tex`` file to be treated by ``ptex2tex``. However, the ``@@@CODE`` line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by a *pro* or *cod* ``ptex2tex``
environment.)


.. _mathtext:

LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text
---------------------------------

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is ``!bt`` (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
``!et``. It is important that ``!bt`` and ``!et`` appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.

Here is the result of a ``!bt`` - ``!et`` block::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f,\label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{eqnarray}


This text looks ugly in all Doconce supported formats, except from
LaTeX and Sphinx.  If HTML is desired, the best is to filter the Doconce text
first to LaTeX and then use the widely available tex4ht tool to
convert the dvi file to HTML, or one could just link a PDF file (made
from LaTeX) directly from HTML. For other textual formats, it is best
to avoid blocks of mathematics and instead use inline mathematics
where it is possible to write expressions both in native LaTeX format
(so it looks good in LaTeX) and in a pure text format (so it looks
okay in other formats).

.. _newcommands:

Macros (Newcommands)
--------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
``newcommand_replace.tex`` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names ``newcommands.tex`` and
``newcommands_keep.tex`` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
``!bt`` and ``!et`` in ``newcommands_keep.tex`` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
``newcommands_replace.tex`` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the ``newcommands*.tex`` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
``newcommand_replace.tex``::


        \newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
        \newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
        \newcommand{\mathbfx}[1]{{\mbox{\boldmath $#1$}}}
        \newcommand{\Q}{\mathbfx{Q}}


and these in ``newcommands_keep.tex``::


        \newcommand{\x}{\mathbfx{x}}
        \newcommand{\normalvec}{\mathbfx{n}}
        \newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}


The LaTeX block::


        \beqa
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep\label{my:eq2}
        \eeqa

will then be rendered to::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\vec u} &=& {\mbox{\boldmath $Q$}} \thinspace . \label{my:eq2}
        \end{eqnarray}

in the current format.

Preprocessing Steps
-------------------

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(`<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_) and mako
(`<http://www.makotemplates.org/>`_). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of ``name=value`` command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable ``FORMAT``
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (``html``, ``latex``,
``plain``, ``rst``, ``sphinx``, ``epydoc``, ``st``).  It is then easy to test on
the value of ``FORMAT`` and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example (see the Doconce
source code of this document to understand how preprocess is used to
create the example).

.. If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated

.. PostScript files are used.



.. Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats



.. figure:: figs/wavepacket_0001.png
   :width: 400

   Wavepacket at time 0.1 s



.. figure:: figs/wavepacket_0010.png
   :width: 400

   Wavepacket at time 0.2 s



Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section `From Doconce to Other Formats`_.

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces
---------------------------------------

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form ``#include "file.do.txt"``.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reStructuredText and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate ``.rst`` files and an index file listing the various ``.rst``
that build up the document. To generate the various ``.rst`` files one
should not run Doconce on the individual ``.do.txt`` files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script ``doconce split_rst``
to split the long, complete ``.rst`` into pieces. This process requires
that each ``#include "file.do.txt`` line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax ``#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>``, where
``file`` is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword ``part:``.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is ``master.do.txt``.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run::


        doconce format sphinx master
        # Split master.rst into parts
        # as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
        files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`
        
        dir=sphinxm-rootdir
        
        if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
          doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
                  version=1.0 theme=default $files
          sh automake-sphinx.sh
        else
          for file in $files; do
            cp $file.rst $dir
          done
          cd $dir
          make html
          cd ..
        fi

The autogenerated ``automake-sphinx.sh`` file (by ``doconce sphinx_dir``)
is compatible with a master ``.rst`` file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to ``doconce sphinx_dir``.
This set is the output of ``doconce split_rst``, which we catch in a
variable ``files`` above.


Missing Features
----------------

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, test on the
``FORMAT`` variable (``#if FORMAT == "latex"``) in the Doconce code and
insert the table in LaTeX format. The ``else`` or ``elif`` branches may
have the table in other formats or a simplified version in the Doconce
table format. Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say::


        # table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce ``doconce format latex mydoc`` to produce ``mydoc.p.tex``. Then
we use the ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst`` commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter::


        Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
                  '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

The ``doconce replace from_text to_text filename`` command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the ``replace`` method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with ``\tableofcontents``, we should use ``doconce subst``,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character::


        Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
                  '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

Note the double backshlash in front of the ``t`` character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The ``doconce subst`` is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

Header and Footer
-----------------

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if ``TITLE:`` or
``#TITLE:`` is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


Troubleshooting
===============

Disclaimer
----------

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running ``doconce format``, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


General Problems
----------------

Figure captions are incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

Preprocessor directives do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

Problems with boldface and emphasize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

Strange non-English characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the encoding of the ``.do.txt`` file with the Unix ``file`` command
or with::


        Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands::


        Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
        Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile



Problems with Code or Tex Blocks
--------------------------------

Code or TeX block errors in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes reStructuredText (reST) reports an "Unexpected indentation"
at the beginning of a code block. If you see a ``!bc``, which should
have been removed by ``doconce format``, it is usually an error in the
Doconce source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if
the line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a
question mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a
newline/space after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among
the mentioned. Then ``!bc`` will most likely be replaced and a double
colon at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in
reST to indicate a verbatim block of text).

Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``idx`` commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the the section `Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code`_ above.  Start the
``!bc`` and ``!ec`` tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the ``!bt`` and ``!et`` tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


Problems with reST Output
-------------------------

Lists do not appear in .rst files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

Inconsistent headings in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rst2*.py`` and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for ``===``,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

Problems with LaTeX Output
--------------------------

The LaTeX file does not compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving::


        \code{...}

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in backquotes in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

Problems with gwiki Output
--------------------------

Strange nested lists in gwiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the ``.gwiki`` file directly.

Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

Debugging
---------

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
``_doconce_debugging.log``, if the to ``doconce format`` after the filename
is ``debug``. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



Basic Parsing Ideas
===================

.. avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea)


The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression::


        (?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?


That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reStructuredText and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reStructuredText or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


A Glimpse of How to Write a New Translator
------------------------------------------

This is the HTML-specific part of the
source code of the HTML translator::


        FILENAME_EXTENSION['html'] = '.html'  # output file extension
        BLANKLINE['html'] = '<p>\n'           # blank input line => new paragraph
        INLINE_TAGS_SUBST['html'] = {         # from inline tags to HTML tags
            # keep math as is:
            'math': None,  # indicates no substitution
            'emphasize':     r'\g<begin><em>\g<subst></em>\g<end>',
            'bold':          r'\g<begin><b>\g<subst></b>\g<end>',
            'verbatim':      r'\g<begin><tt>\g<subst></tt>\g<end>',
            'URL':           r'\g<begin><a href="\g<url>">\g<link></a>',
            'section':       r'<h1>\g<subst></h1>',
            'subsection':    r'<h3>\g<subst></h3>',
            'subsubsection': r'<h5>\g<subst></h5>',
            'paragraph':     r'<b>\g<subst></b>. ',
            'title':         r'<title>\g<subst></title>\n<center><h1>\g<subst></h1></center>',
            'date':          r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',
            'author':        r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',
            }
        
        # how to replace code and latex blocks by html (<pre>) environment:
        def html_code(filestr):
            c = re.compile(r'^!bc(.*?)\n', re.MULTILINE)
            filestr = c.sub(r'<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK \g<1>-->\n<pre>\n', filestr)
            filestr = re.sub(r'!ec\n',
                             r'</pre>\n<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->\n', filestr)
            c = re.compile(r'^!bt\n', re.MULTILINE)
            filestr = c.sub(r'<pre>\n', filestr)
            filestr = re.sub(r'!et\n', r'</pre>\n', filestr)
            return filestr
        CODE['html'] = html_code
        
        # how to typeset lists and their items in html:
        LIST['html'] = {
            'itemize':
            {'begin': '\n<ul>\n', 'item': '<li>', 'end': '</ul>\n\n'},
            'enumerate':
            {'begin': '\n<ol>\n', 'item': '<li>', 'end': '</ol>\n\n'},
            'description':
            {'begin': '\n<dl>\n', 'item': '<dt>%s<dd>', 'end': '</dl>\n\n'},
            }
        
        # how to type set description lists for function arguments, return
        # values, and module/class variables:
        ARGLIST['html'] = {
            'parameter': '<b>argument</b>',
            'keyword': '<b>keyword argument</b>',
            'return': '<b>return value(s)</b>',
            'instance variable': '<b>instance variable</b>',
            'class variable': '<b>class variable</b>',
            'module variable': '<b>module variable</b>',
            }
        
        # document start:
        INTRO['html'] = """
        <html>
        <body bgcolor="white">
        """
        # document ending:
        OUTRO['html'] = """
        </body>
        </html>
        """



Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that ``argument``, ``keyword argument``, ``return``,
``instance variable``, ``class variable``, and ``module variable`` are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted::


            - argument x: x value (float),
              which must be a positive number.
            - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
              the iterations.
            - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
            - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
            - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
            - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
              (bool variable).


The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    module variable x: 
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.

    module variable tolerance: 
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

What Is Doconce?
================

.. index::
   pair: doconce; short explanation


Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown, Pandoc, and AsciiDoc, but less than reST, and very much
    less than LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, or MS Word.
    With `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_, Doconce can
    display computer code in LaTeX in many sophisticated ways (almost
    50 styles are available).

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    MS Word documents, in wikis, or as Sphinx documents.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting may face problems
when transformed to other formats.



Dependencies
------------

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either `Preprocess <http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_ or `Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org>`_ must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need `ptex2tex <http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>`_ and some style
files that ``ptex2tex`` potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_.  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_.
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

Demos
-----


.. index:: demos


The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the

.. code-block:: console

        docs/manual/manual.do.txt

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
`demo web page <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>`_
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file ``make.sh`` in the same directory as the ``manual.do.txt`` file
(the current text) shows how to run ``doconce format`` on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in

.. code-block:: console

        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

In the ``tutorial`` directory there is also a ``make.sh`` file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
`web demo <https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>`_
of the results.

.. Example on including another Doconce file:



.. _doconce2formats:

From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document ``mydoc.do.txt`` to various other
formats applies the script ``doconce format``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to ``mako`` or ``preprocess`` can be added after the
filename. For example,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable ``FORMAT`` is always defined as the current format when
running ``preprocess``. That is, in the last example, ``FORMAT`` is
defined as ``latex``. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like ``#if FORMAT == "latex"``.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code:

.. code-block:: py


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file ``mydoc.do.txt``
is performed by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file ``mydoc.html`` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file ``mydoc.tex`` from ``mydoc.do.txt`` is done in two steps:
.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many

.. formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph

.. environment, as used here.


*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form ``mydoc.p.tex`` for
     ``ptex2tex``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files ``newcommands.tex``, ``newcommands_keep.tex``, or
``newcommands_replace.tex`` (see the section :ref:`newcommands`).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ``ptex2tex`` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a ``.p.tex`` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc

A separate titlepage can be generate by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc


The ``ptex2tex`` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any ``!bc`` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
file, e.g., ``!bc cod`` for a code snippet, where ``cod`` is set to
a certain environment in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` (e.g., ``CodeIntended``).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

*Step 3.* Compile ``mydoc.tex``
and create the PDF file:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the ``Minted_Python``, ``Minted_Cpp``, etc., environments
in ``ptex2tex`` for typesetting code, the ``minted`` LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running ``doconce format`` with the
``-DMINTED`` option:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, ``latex`` must be run with the
``-shell-escape`` option:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

The ``-shell-escape`` option is required because the ``minted.sty`` style
file runs the ``pygments`` program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from ``latex`` without the ``-shell-escape`` option.


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file ``mydoc.rst``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file ``mydoc.odt`` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords ``author``, ``title``, and ``version`` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, ``version`` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files ``file1``,
``file2``, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files ``file1``, ``file2``, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of ``dirname`` is ``sphinx-rootdir``. The ``theme``
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ``'default'``).

With a single-file document in ``mydoc.do.txt`` one often just runs

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory ``sphinx-rootdir`` is made with
relevant files.

The ``doconce sphinx_dir`` command generates a script
``automake-sphinx.sh`` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named ``figs`` or ``figures``
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, ``automake-sphinx.sh`` must be edited accordingly. One
can either run ``automake-sphinx.sh`` or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the ``conf.py``
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
``make-themes.sh`` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes ``fenics`` and ``pyramid``, one writes

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are ``_build/html_fenics``
and ``_build/html_pyramid``, respectively. Without arguments,
``make-themes.sh`` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file ``mydoc.do.txt``.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory with a ``conf.py`` file,
either manually or by using the interactive ``sphinx-quickstart``
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:

.. code-block:: console

        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


*Step 3.* Copy the ``tutorial.rst`` file to the Sphinx root directory:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with ``mydoc.rst`` in the ``sphinx-rootdir``
directory. Either edit ``mydoc.rst`` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to ``sphinx-rootdir``.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated ``index.rst`` file so that ``mydoc.rst``
is included, i.e., add ``mydoc`` to the ``toctree`` section so that it becomes

.. code-block:: py


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before ``mydoc`` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:

.. code-block:: console

        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


*Step 6.* View the result:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows ``!bc``: ``cod`` gives Python
(``code-block:: python`` in Sphinx syntax) and ``cppcod`` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Google Code Wiki
----------------

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by `Google Code <http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>`_.
The transformation to this format, called ``gwiki`` to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the ``mydoc.gwiki`` output file from ``doconce format`` and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press **Preview** or **Save Page** to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
``.rst`` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if ``.eps`` or ``.png`` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The ``make.sh`` files in ``docs/manual`` and ``docs/tutorial``
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



The Doconce Markup Language
===========================

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

Lists
-----

An unordered bullet list makes use of the ``*`` as bullet sign
and is indented as follows


.. code-block:: py


           * item 1
        
           * item 2
        
             * subitem 1, if there are more
               lines, each line must
               be intended as shown here
        
             * subitem 2,
               also spans two lines
        
           * item 3


This list gets typeset as

   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines


   * item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an ``o`` (as the first letter
in "ordered"):


.. code-block:: py


           o item 1
        
           o item 2
        
             * subitem 1
        
             * subitem 2
        
           o item 3


resulting in

  1. item 1

  2. item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2


  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:


.. code-block:: py


           - keyword1: explanation of keyword1
        
           - keyword2: explanation
             of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
             if there are multiple lines)


The result becomes

   keyword1: 
     explanation of keyword1

   keyword2: 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple lines)

Special Lines
-------------

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


.. index:: TITLE keyword

.. index:: AUTHOR keyword

.. index:: DATE keyword


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with ``TITLE:``, ``AUTHOR:``, and ``DATE:`` are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax

.. code-block:: py


        name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3

The ``at`` with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the ``and`` with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
Multiple authors require multiple ``AUTHOR:`` lines. All information
associated with ``TITLE:`` and ``AUTHOR:`` keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:

.. code-block:: py


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: November 9, 2016

Note the how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including reStructuredText and Sphinx)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:

.. code-block:: py


        Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
        Kaare Dump [3]
        A. Dummy Author
        
        [1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
        [2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
        [3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.


.. index:: headlines

.. index:: section headings


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   * 7 underscores or equal signs for sections

   * 5 for subsections

   * 3 for subsubsections

   * 2 underscrores (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by blanks if desired.

Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: py


        ======= Example on a Section Heading =======
        
        The running text goes here.
        
              ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
        The running text goes here.
        
                  ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        __A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.


The result for the present format looks like this:

Example on a Section Heading
============================

The running text goes here.

Example on a Subsection Heading
-------------------------------
The running text goes here.

Example on a Subsubsection Heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The running text goes here.

*A Paragraph.* The running text goes here.

Special Lines
=============

Figures
-------

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax

.. code-block:: py


        FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say ``.eps`` when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's ``convert`` utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for ``TITLE:`` and ``AUTHOR:`` lines, all information
related to a figure line must be written on the same line. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as ``FIGURE:`` will be
included in the formatted caption).


.. _fig:viz:

.. figure:: figs/streamtubes.png
   :width: 400

   Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow  


Movies
------

Here is an example on the ``MOVIE:`` keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the ``latex``, ``html``, ``rst``, and ``sphinx`` formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.

.. code-block:: py


        MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption


.. latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies,

.. or just plain \h:ref:`run: ...`{...}


.. raw:: html
        
        <EMBED SRC="figs/mjolnir.mpeg" width=600 height=470 AUTOPLAY="TRUE" LOOP="TRUE"></EMBED>
        <P>
        <EM></EM>
        </P>



.. MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470]


.. MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470]


The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the ``movie15`` package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable ``MOVIE15``. There is an associated variable
``EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER`` which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc


The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
``myframes*.png``. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the ``MOVIE:`` command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



Copying Computer Code from Source Files
---------------------------------------

Another type of special lines starts with ``@@@CODE`` and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section :ref:`sec:verbatim:blocks` below.


.. _inline:tagging:

Inline Tagging
--------------

.. index:: inline tagging

.. index:: emphasized words

.. index:: boldface words

.. index:: verbatim text


.. index:: inline comments


Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, **boldface phrases**,
and ``verbatim text`` (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as :math:`\nu = \sin(x)`.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in

.. code-block:: py


        *emphasized words*


Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:

.. code-block:: py


        _several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

The line above gets typeset as
**several words in boldface** followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between backquotes:

.. code-block:: py


        `call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
        while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

The typesetting result looks like this:
``call myroutine(a, b)`` looks like a Fortran call
while ``void myfunc(double *a, double *b)`` must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and ``ptex2tex``) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing backquotes and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as

.. code-block:: py


        some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"

which appears as some URL like `Search Google <http://google.com>`_.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in ``.txt``, ``.html``, or ``.pdf`` follows the same
setup:

.. code-block:: py


        see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt"

which appears as see the `Doconce Manual <manual.do.txt>`_.

Links to files with other extensions must be realized
*with the filename as link text*, written as
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:

.. code-block:: py


        URL: "manual.xml"

.. These work as well: `<manual.xml>`_ `<manual.xml>`_

.. `<manual.xml>`_

resulting in the link `<manual.xml>`_.

To have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:

.. code-block:: py


        Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

resulting in Click on this link: `<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>`_.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:

.. code-block:: py


        [name: comment]

where ``name`` is the name of the author of the command, and ``comment`` is a
plain text text. (**hpl**: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized.)
The name and comment are visible in the output unless ``doconce format``
is run with a command-line specification of removing such comments
(see the chapter :ref:`doconce2formats` for an example). Inline comments
(**hpl**: Here is a specific example on an inline comment. It can
span several lines.)
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the ``.do.txt`` file
(see the chapter :ref:`doconce2formats`).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Most formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX (Epytext has some
inline math support that is utilized).  However, mathematical
expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains special formatting
commands, which may appear annoying in plain text. Doconce therefore
supports an extended inline math syntax where the writer can provide
an alternative syntax suited for formats close to plain ASCII:

.. code-block:: py


        Here is an example on a linear system
        ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
        where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
        $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in LaTeX, while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system :math:`{\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}`, where :math:`\bf A`
is an :math:`n\times n` matrix, and :math:`\bf x` and :math:`\bf b`
are vectors of length :math:`n`."

Cross-Referencing
-----------------

.. index:: cross referencing

.. index:: labels

.. index:: references


References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:

.. code-block:: py


        label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
        For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reStructuredText commands by ``doconce format``. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure :ref:`fig:viz`
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections :ref:`mathtext` and :ref:`newcommands` are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say (:ref:`my:eq1`)--(:ref:`my:eq2`). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section :ref:`inline:tagging`.

Index and Bibliography
----------------------

.. index:: index

.. index:: citations

.. index:: bibliography


An index can be created for the LaTeX and the reStructuredText or
Sphinx formats by the ``idx`` keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:

.. code-block:: py


        idx{some index entry}
        idx{main entry!subentry}
        idx{`verbatim_text` and more}

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to

.. code-block:: py


        \index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: ``idx``
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reStructuredText and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:

.. code-block:: py


        as found in cite{Larsen:86,Nielsen:99}.

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding ``cite`` command; in reStructuredText
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like

.. code-block:: py


        as found in [3][14]

if ``Larsen:86`` has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and ``Nielsen:99`` is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword ``BIBFILE:``,
which is optionally followed by a BibTeX file, having extension ``.bib``,
a corresponding reStructuredText bibliography, having extension ``.rst``,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension ``.py``.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,

.. code-block:: py


        {
        'Nielsen:99': """
        K. Nielsen. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
        URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
        """,
        'Larsen:86':
        """
        O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
        *Personal Press*. 1986.
        """
        }

In the LaTeX format, the ``.bib`` file will be used in the standard way,
in the reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the ``.rst`` file will be
copied into the document at the place where the ``BIBFILE:`` keyword
appears, while all other formats will make use of the Python dictionary
typeset as an ordered Doconce list, replacing the ``BIBFILE:`` line
in the document.

At present, only one file with bibliographic references can be used.

.. see ketch/tex2rst for nice bibtex to rst converter which could

.. be used here


Conversion of BibTeX databases to reStructuredText format can be
done by the `bibliograph.parsing <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/>`_ tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [Python:Primer:09]_, a paper [Osnes:98]_,
and both of them simultaneously [Python:Primer:09]_ [Osnes:98]_.

(**somereader**: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) )


Tables
------

A table like

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:

.. code-block:: py


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters ``c``, ``r``, or ``l`` to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes ``|`` can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (reStructuredText and Sphinx are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



.. _sec:verbatim:blocks:

Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code
--------------------------------

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" ``!bc`` keyword and an "end code" ``!ec`` keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  There may be an argument after the ``!bc`` tag to specify a
certain ``ptex2tex`` environment (for instance, ``!bc dat`` corresponds to
the data file environment in ``ptex2tex``, and ``!bc cod`` is typically
used for a code snippet, but any argument can be defined). If there is
no argument, one assumes the ccq environment, which is plain LaTeX
verbatim in the default ``.ptex2tex.cfg``. However, all these arguments
can be redefined in the ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` file.

The argument after ``!bc`` is also used
in a Sphinx context. Then argument is mapped onto a valid Pygments
language for typesetting of the verbatim block by Pygments. This
mapping takes place in an optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce
source file, e.g.,

.. code-block:: py


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

Here, three arguments are defined: ``pycod`` for Python code,
``cod`` also for Python code, ``cppcod`` for C++ code, and ``sys``
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in ``.ptex2tex.cfg`` for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, ``pro`` is used for complete programs in Python, ``cod``
is for a code snippet in Python, while ``xcod`` and ``xpro`` implies
computer language specific typesetting where ``x`` can be
``f`` for Fortran, ``c`` for C, ``cpp`` for C++, and ``py`` for Python.
The argument ``sys`` means by default ``console`` for Sphinx and
``CodeTerminal`` (ptex2tex environent) for LaTeX. All these definitions
of the arguments after ``!bc`` can be redefined in the ``.ptex2tex.cfg``
configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the ``sphinx code-blocks``
comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages is easily added.

.. (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code

.. blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments

.. and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the

.. first one is used.)


The enclosing ``!ec`` tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (``pycod`` style):

.. code-block:: python

        # regular expressions for inline tags:
        inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
        inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
        INLINE_TAGS = {
            'emphasize':
            r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'verbatim':
            r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'bold':
            r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
        }

And here is a C++ code snippet (``cppcod`` style):

.. code-block:: c++

        void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
            for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
                myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
            }
        }


Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then

.. code-block:: py


         @@@CODE myfile.f
         @@@CODE myfile.f fromto:subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

The first line implies that all lines in the file ``myfile.f`` are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a ``!bc pro`` environment.  The
second line has a `fromto:' directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc cod`
environment. (The ``pro`` and ``cod`` arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain ``!bc`` environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
``@`` sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching ``subroutine test``
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching ``C END1`` (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):


.. code-block:: py


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the ``fromto:``
directive above:


.. code-block:: py

              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        


(Remark for those familiar with ``ptex2tex``: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in ``ptex2tex``. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
``.p.tex`` file to be treated by ``ptex2tex``. However, the ``@@@CODE`` line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by a *pro* or *cod* ``ptex2tex``
environment.)


.. _mathtext:

LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text
---------------------------------

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is ``!bt`` (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
``!et``. It is important that ``!bt`` and ``!et`` appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.

Here is the result of a ``!bt`` - ``!et`` block:

.. math::
   :label: myeq1
        
        {\partial u\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla^2 u + f,\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t}  &=  \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        


This text looks ugly in all Doconce supported formats, except from
LaTeX and Sphinx.  If HTML is desired, the best is to filter the Doconce text
first to LaTeX and then use the widely available tex4ht tool to
convert the dvi file to HTML, or one could just link a PDF file (made
from LaTeX) directly from HTML. For other textual formats, it is best
to avoid blocks of mathematics and instead use inline mathematics
where it is possible to write expressions both in native LaTeX format
(so it looks good in LaTeX) and in a pure text format (so it looks
okay in other formats).

.. _newcommands:

Macros (Newcommands)
--------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
``newcommand_replace.tex`` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names ``newcommands.tex`` and
``newcommands_keep.tex`` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
``!bt`` and ``!et`` in ``newcommands_keep.tex`` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
``newcommands_replace.tex`` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the ``newcommands*.tex`` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
``newcommand_replace.tex``:


.. code-block:: py


        \newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
        \newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
        \newcommand{\mathbfx}[1]{{\mbox{\boldmath $#1$}}}
        \newcommand{\Q}{\mathbfx{Q}}


and these in ``newcommands_keep.tex``:


.. code-block:: py


        \newcommand{\x}{\mathbfx{x}}
        \newcommand{\normalvec}{\mathbfx{n}}
        \newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}


The LaTeX block

.. code-block:: py


        \beqa
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep\label{my:eq2}
        \eeqa

will then be rendered to

.. math::
        
        {\mbox{\boldmath $x$}}\cdot{\mbox{\boldmath $n$}}  &=  0,\\
        \frac{D\vec u}{dt}  &=  {\mbox{\boldmath $Q$}} \thinspace . 
        

in the current format.

Preprocessing Steps
-------------------

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(`<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>`_) and mako
(`<http://www.makotemplates.org/>`_). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of ``name=value`` command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable ``FORMAT``
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (``html``, ``latex``,
``plain``, ``rst``, ``sphinx``, ``epydoc``, ``st``).  It is then easy to test on
the value of ``FORMAT`` and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example (see the Doconce
source code of this document to understand how preprocess is used to
create the example).

.. If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated

.. PostScript files are used.



.. Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats



.. figure:: figs/wavepacket_0001.png
   :width: 400

   Wavepacket at time 0.1 s



.. figure:: figs/wavepacket_0010.png
   :width: 400

   Wavepacket at time 0.2 s



Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section :ref:`doconce2formats`.

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces
---------------------------------------

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form ``#include "file.do.txt"``.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reStructuredText and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate ``.rst`` files and an index file listing the various ``.rst``
that build up the document. To generate the various ``.rst`` files one
should not run Doconce on the individual ``.do.txt`` files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script ``doconce split_rst``
to split the long, complete ``.rst`` into pieces. This process requires
that each ``#include "file.do.txt`` line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax ``#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>``, where
``file`` is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword ``part:``.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is ``master.do.txt``.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run

.. code-block:: py

        doconce format sphinx master
        # Split master.rst into parts
        # as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
        files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`
        
        dir=sphinxm-rootdir
        
        if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
          doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
                  version=1.0 theme=default $files
          sh automake-sphinx.sh
        else
          for file in $files; do
            cp $file.rst $dir
          done
          cd $dir
          make html
          cd ..
        fi

The autogenerated ``automake-sphinx.sh`` file (by ``doconce sphinx_dir``)
is compatible with a master ``.rst`` file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to ``doconce sphinx_dir``.
This set is the output of ``doconce split_rst``, which we catch in a
variable ``files`` above.


Missing Features
----------------

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, test on the
``FORMAT`` variable (``#if FORMAT == "latex"``) in the Doconce code and
insert the table in LaTeX format. The ``else`` or ``elif`` branches may
have the table in other formats or a simplified version in the Doconce
table format. Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say

.. code-block:: py


        # table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce ``doconce format latex mydoc`` to produce ``mydoc.p.tex``. Then
we use the ``doconce replace`` and ``doconce subst`` commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:

.. code-block:: py


        Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
                  '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

The ``doconce replace from_text to_text filename`` command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the ``replace`` method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with ``\tableofcontents``, we should use ``doconce subst``,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:

.. code-block:: py


        Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
                  '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

Note the double backshlash in front of the ``t`` character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The ``doconce subst`` is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

Header and Footer
-----------------

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if ``TITLE:`` or
``#TITLE:`` is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


Troubleshooting
===============

Disclaimer
----------

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running ``doconce format``, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


General Problems
----------------

Figure captions are incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

Preprocessor directives do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

Problems with boldface and emphasize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

Strange non-English characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the encoding of the ``.do.txt`` file with the Unix ``file`` command
or with

.. code-block:: py


        Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands

.. code-block:: py


        Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
        Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile



Problems with Code or Tex Blocks
--------------------------------

Code or TeX block errors in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes reStructuredText (reST) reports an "Unexpected indentation"
at the beginning of a code block. If you see a ``!bc``, which should
have been removed by ``doconce format``, it is usually an error in the
Doconce source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if
the line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a
question mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a
newline/space after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among
the mentioned. Then ``!bc`` will most likely be replaced and a double
colon at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in
reST to indicate a verbatim block of text).

Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``idx`` commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the the section :ref:`sec:verbatim:blocks` above.  Start the
``!bc`` and ``!ec`` tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the ``!bt`` and ``!et`` tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


Problems with reST Output
-------------------------

Lists do not appear in .rst files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

Inconsistent headings in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``rst2*.py`` and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for ``===``,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

Problems with LaTeX Output
--------------------------

The LaTeX file does not compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving

.. code-block:: py


        \code{...}

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in backquotes in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

Problems with gwiki Output
--------------------------

Strange nested lists in gwiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the ``.gwiki`` file directly.

Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

Debugging
---------

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
``_doconce_debugging.log``, if the to ``doconce format`` after the filename
is ``debug``. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



Basic Parsing Ideas
===================

.. avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea)


The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression


.. code-block:: py


        (?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?


That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reStructuredText and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reStructuredText or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


A Glimpse of How to Write a New Translator
------------------------------------------

This is the HTML-specific part of the
source code of the HTML translator:



.. code-block:: py


        FILENAME_EXTENSION['html'] = '.html'  # output file extension
        BLANKLINE['html'] = '<p>\n'           # blank input line => new paragraph
        INLINE_TAGS_SUBST['html'] = {         # from inline tags to HTML tags
            # keep math as is:
            'math': None,  # indicates no substitution
            'emphasize':     r'\g<begin><em>\g<subst></em>\g<end>',
            'bold':          r'\g<begin><b>\g<subst></b>\g<end>',
            'verbatim':      r'\g<begin><tt>\g<subst></tt>\g<end>',
            'URL':           r'\g<begin><a href="\g<url>">\g<link></a>',
            'section':       r'<h1>\g<subst></h1>',
            'subsection':    r'<h3>\g<subst></h3>',
            'subsubsection': r'<h5>\g<subst></h5>',
            'paragraph':     r'<b>\g<subst></b>. ',
            'title':         r'<title>\g<subst></title>\n<center><h1>\g<subst></h1></center>',
            'date':          r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',
            'author':        r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',
            }
        
        # how to replace code and latex blocks by html (<pre>) environment:
        def html_code(filestr):
            c = re.compile(r'^!bc(.*?)\n', re.MULTILINE)
            filestr = c.sub(r'<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK \g<1>-->\n<pre>\n', filestr)
            filestr = re.sub(r'!ec\n',
                             r'</pre>\n<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->\n', filestr)
            c = re.compile(r'^!bt\n', re.MULTILINE)
            filestr = c.sub(r'<pre>\n', filestr)
            filestr = re.sub(r'!et\n', r'</pre>\n', filestr)
            return filestr
        CODE['html'] = html_code
        
        # how to typeset lists and their items in html:
        LIST['html'] = {
            'itemize':
            {'begin': '\n<ul>\n', 'item': '<li>', 'end': '</ul>\n\n'},
            'enumerate':
            {'begin': '\n<ol>\n', 'item': '<li>', 'end': '</ol>\n\n'},
            'description':
            {'begin': '\n<dl>\n', 'item': '<dt>%s<dd>', 'end': '</dl>\n\n'},
            }
        
        # how to type set description lists for function arguments, return
        # values, and module/class variables:
        ARGLIST['html'] = {
            'parameter': '<b>argument</b>',
            'keyword': '<b>keyword argument</b>',
            'return': '<b>return value(s)</b>',
            'instance variable': '<b>instance variable</b>',
            'class variable': '<b>class variable</b>',
            'module variable': '<b>module variable</b>',
            }
        
        # document start:
        INTRO['html'] = """
        <html>
        <body bgcolor="white">
        """
        # document ending:
        OUTRO['html'] = """
        </body>
        </html>
        """



Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that ``argument``, ``keyword argument``, ``return``,
``instance variable``, ``class variable``, and ``module variable`` are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.


.. code-block:: py


            - argument x: x value (float),
              which must be a positive number.
            - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
              the iterations.
            - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
            - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
            - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
            - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
              (bool variable).


The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    :var x: 
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.

    :var tolerance: 
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

== What Is Doconce? ==

Doconce is two things:


 # Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the    latter to RTF and MS Word.    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)
 # Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:


  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than    Markdown, Pandoc, and AsciiDoc, but less than reST, and very much    less than LaTeX and HTML.
  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code    directly from the source code files.
  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,    Pandoc is a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:


  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, or MS Word.    With [http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex ptex2tex], Doconce can    display computer code in LaTeX in many sophisticated ways (almost    50 styles are available).
  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as    MS Word documents, in wikis, or as Sphinx documents.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting may face problems
when transformed to other formats.

==== Dependencies ====

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either [http://code.google.com/p/preprocess Preprocess] or [http://www.makotemplates.org Mako] must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need [http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex ptex2tex] and some style
files that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires [http://docutils.sourceforge.net docutils].  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course [http://sphinx.pocoo.org Sphinx].
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to [http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ Pandoc] is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.

==== Demos ====

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the
{{{
docs/manual/manual.do.txt
}}}
file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html demo web page]
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file `make.sh` in the same directory as the `manual.do.txt` file
(the current text) shows how to run `doconce format` on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in
{{{
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
}}}
In the `tutorial` directory there is also a `make.sh` file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
[https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html web demo]
of the results.

== From Doconce to Other Formats ==

Transformation of a Doconce document `mydoc.do.txt` to various other
formats applies the script `doconce format`:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt
}}}
or just
{{{
Terminal> doconce format format mydoc
}}}
The `mako` or `preprocess` programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to `mako` or `preprocess` can be added after the
filename. For example,
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako
}}}
The variable `FORMAT` is always defined as the current format when
running `preprocess`. That is, in the last example, `FORMAT` is
defined as `latex`. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like `#if FORMAT == "latex"`.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments
}}}
One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code:
{{{
Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc
}}}
This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

==== HTML ====

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file `mydoc.do.txt`
is performed by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format html mydoc
}}}
The resulting file `mydoc.html` can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

==== LaTeX ====

Making a LaTeX file `mydoc.tex` from `mydoc.do.txt` is done in two steps:
<wiki:comment> Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> environment, as used here. </wiki:comment>

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form `mydoc.p.tex` for
     `ptex2tex`:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc
}}}
LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files `newcommands.tex`, `newcommands_keep.tex`, or
`newcommands_replace.tex` (see the section [#Macros_(Newcommands)]).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run `ptex2tex` (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file,
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc
}}}
or just perform a plain copy,
{{{
Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex
}}}
Doconce generates a `.p.tex` file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
}}}
The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc
}}}
A separate titlepage can be generate by
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc
}}}

The `ptex2tex` tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any `!bc` command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your `.ptex2tex.cfg`
file, e.g., `!bc cod` for a code snippet, where `cod` is set to
a certain environment in `.ptex2tex.cfg` (e.g., `CodeIntended`).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

*Step 3.* Compile `mydoc.tex`
and create the PDF file:
{{{
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}
If one wishes to use the `Minted_Python`, `Minted_Cpp`, etc., environments
in `ptex2tex` for typesetting code, the `minted` LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running `doconce format` with the
`-DMINTED` option:
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc
}}}
In this case, `latex` must be run with the
`-shell-escape` option:
{{{
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal> dvipdf mydoc
}}}
The `-shell-escape` option is required because the `minted.sty` style
file runs the `pygments` program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from `latex` without the `-shell-escape` option.

==== Plain ASCII Text ====

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt
}}}

==== reStructuredText ====

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file `mydoc.rst`:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt
}}}
We may now produce various other formats:
{{{
Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice
}}}
The OpenOffice file `mydoc.odt` can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

==== Sphinx ====

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the `doconce sphinx_dir` command:
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
          title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...
}}}
The keywords `author`, `title`, and `version` are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, `version` is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files `file1`,
`file2`, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files `file1`, `file2`, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of `dirname` is `sphinx-rootdir`. The `theme`
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is `'default'`).

With a single-file document in `mydoc.do.txt` one often just runs
{{{
Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc
}}}
and then an appropriate Sphinx directory `sphinx-rootdir` is made with
relevant files.

The `doconce sphinx_dir` command generates a script
`automake-sphinx.sh` for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named `figs` or `figures`
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, `automake-sphinx.sh` must be edited accordingly. One
can either run `automake-sphinx.sh` or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the `conf.py`
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
`make-themes.sh` can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes `fenics` and `pyramid`, one writes
{{{
Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid
}}}
The resulting directories with HTML documents are `_build/html_fenics`
and `_build/html_pyramid`, respectively. Without arguments,
`make-themes.sh` makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file `mydoc.do.txt`.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format:
{{{
Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc
}}}

*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory with a `conf.py` file,
either manually or by using the interactive `sphinx-quickstart`
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:
{{{
mkdir sphinx-rootdir
sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
sphinx-rootdir
n
_
Name of My Sphinx Document
Author
version
version
.rst
index
n
y
n
n
n
n
y
n
n
y
y
y
EOF
}}}

*Step 3.* Copy the `tutorial.rst` file to the Sphinx root directory:
{{{
Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir
}}}
If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with `mydoc.rst` in the `sphinx-rootdir`
directory. Either edit `mydoc.rst` so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to `sphinx-rootdir`.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated `index.rst` file so that `mydoc.rst`
is included, i.e., add `mydoc` to the `toctree` section so that it becomes
{{{
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc
}}}
(The spaces before `mydoc` are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:
{{{
make clean   # remove old versions
make html
}}}

*Step 6.* View the result:
{{{
Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html
}}}

Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows `!bc`: `cod` gives Python
(`code-block:: python` in Sphinx syntax) and `cppcod` gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.

==== Google Code Wiki ====

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax Google Code].
The transformation to this format, called `gwiki` to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by
{{{
Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
}}}
You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the `mydoc.gwiki` output file from `doconce format` and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press *Preview* or *Save Page* to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).

==== Tweaking the Doconce Output ====

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
`.rst` file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if `.eps` or `.png` is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The `make.sh` files in `docs/manual` and `docs/tutorial`
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



== The Doconce Markup Language ==

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

==== Lists ====

An unordered bullet list makes use of the `*` as bullet sign
and is indented as follows

{{{
   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   * item 3
}}}

This list gets typeset as


   * item 1
   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more       lines, each line must       be intended as shown here
     * subitem 2,       also spans two lines


   * item 3

(As seen, nested lists in (g)wiki format are not treated well by
Doconce. Plain unnested lists work fine. And the (g)wiki format
automatically puts multiple lines of an item on a single line as
required :-)

In an ordered list, each item starts with an `o` (as the first letter
in "ordered"):

{{{
   o item 1

   o item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2

   o item 3
}}}

resulting in


  # item 1
  # item 2

     * subitem 1
     * subitem 2


  # item 3

(Again, there are problems with mixing nested lists and liststypes
for the (g)wiki format.)

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon:

{{{
   - keyword1: explanation of keyword1

   - keyword2: explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple lines)
}}}

The result becomes


   * keyword1:  
     explanation of keyword1
   * keyword2:  
     explanation     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly     if there are multiple lines)

==== Special Lines ====

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with `TITLE:`, `AUTHOR:`, and `DATE:` are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax
{{{
name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3
}}}
The `at` with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the `and` with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
Multiple authors require multiple `AUTHOR:` lines. All information
associated with `TITLE:` and `AUTHOR:` keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example:
{{{
TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
AUTHOR: Kaare Dump at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
DATE: November 9, 2016
}}}
Note the how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including reStructuredText and Sphinx)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format:
{{{
Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
Kaare Dump [3]
A. Dummy Author

[1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
[2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
[3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
}}}
Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):


   * 7 underscores or equal signs for sections
   * 5 for subsections
   * 3 for subsubsections
   * 2 underscrores (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by blanks if desired.

Here are some examples:
{{{
======= Example on a Section Heading =======

The running text goes here.

      ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
The running text goes here.

          ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===

The running text goes here.

__A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.
}}}

The result for the present format looks like this:



== Example on a Section Heading ==

The running text goes here.

==== Example on a Subsection Heading ====

The running text goes here.

==== Example on a Subsubsection Heading ====

The running text goes here.

*A Paragraph.* The running text goes here.



== Special Lines ==

==== Figures ====

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax
{{{
FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption
}}}
The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say `.eps` when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's `convert` utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for `TITLE:` and `AUTHOR:` lines, all information
related to a figure line must be written on the same line. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as `FIGURE:` will be
included in the formatted caption).



---------------------------------------------------------------

Figure:  Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. (fig:viz)

https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/manual/figs/streamtubes.png

<wiki:comment>
Put the figure file figs/streamtubes.png on the web (e.g., as part of the
googlecode repository) and substitute the line above with the URL.
</wiki:comment>
---------------------------------------------------------------

==== Movies ====

Here is an example on the `MOVIE:` keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the `latex`, `html`, `rst`, and `sphinx` formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie.
{{{
MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption
}}}

<wiki:comment> latex/PDF format can make use of the movie15 package for displaying movies, </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> or just plain \hrun: ...{...} </wiki:comment>

 (Movie figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play mjolnir.html)

<wiki:comment> MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket.gif, width=600 height=470] </wiki:comment>

<wiki:comment> MOVIE: [figs/wavepacket2.mpeg, width=600 height=470] </wiki:comment>

The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the `movie15` package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable `MOVIE15`. There is an associated variable
`EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER` which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader):
{{{
Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc
}}}

The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
`myframes*.png`. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the `MOVIE:` command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).

==== Copying Computer Code from Source Files ====

Another type of special lines starts with `@@@CODE` and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section [#Blocks_of_Verbatim_Computer_Code] below.

==== Inline Tagging ====

Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, *boldface phrases*,
and `verbatim text` (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as `v = sin(x)`.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in
{{{
*emphasized words*
}}}

Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk:
{{{
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.
}}}
The line above gets typeset as
*several words in boldface* followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between backquotes:
{{{
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.
}}}
The typesetting result looks like this:
`call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and `ptex2tex`) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing backquotes and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as
{{{
some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
}}}
which appears as some URL like [http://google.com Search Google].
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in `.txt`, `.html`, or `.pdf` follows the same
setup:
{{{
see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt"
}}}
which appears as see the [manual.do.txt Doconce Manual].

Links to files with other extensions must be realized
*with the filename as link text*, written as
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:
{{{
URL: "manual.xml"
}}}
<wiki:comment> These work as well: manual.xml manual.xml </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> manual.xml </wiki:comment>
resulting in the link manual.xml.

To have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes:
{{{
Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".
}}}
resulting in Click on this link: http://code.google.com/p/doconce.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:
{{{
[name: comment]
}}}
where `name` is the name of the author of the command, and `comment` is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless `doconce format`
is run with a command-line specification of removing such comments
(see the chapter [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats] for an example). Inline comments
[hpl: Here is a specific example on an inline comment. It can
span several lines.]
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the `.do.txt` file
(see the chapter [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats]).

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Most formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX (Epytext has some
inline math support that is utilized).  However, mathematical
expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains special formatting
commands, which may appear annoying in plain text. Doconce therefore
supports an extended inline math syntax where the writer can provide
an alternative syntax suited for formats close to plain ASCII:
{{{
Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.
}}}
That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in LaTeX, while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system `Ax=b`, where `A`
is an `nxn` matrix, and `x` and `b`
are vectors of length `n`."

==== Cross-Referencing ====

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:
{{{
label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.
}}}
This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reStructuredText commands by `doconce format`. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure fig:viz
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections [#LaTeX_Blocks_of_Mathematical_Text] and [#Macros_(Newcommands)] are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section [#Inline_Tagging].

==== Index and Bibliography ====

An index can be created for the LaTeX and the reStructuredText or
Sphinx formats by the `idx` keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax:
{{{
idx{some index entry}
idx{main entry!subentry}
idx{`verbatim_text` and more}
}}}
The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to
{{{
\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}
}}}
Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: `idx`
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reStructuredText and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:
{{{
as found in cite{Larsen:86,Nielsen:99}.
}}}
Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding `cite` command; in reStructuredText
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like
{{{
as found in [3][14]
}}}
if `Larsen:86` has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and `Nielsen:99` is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword `BIBFILE:`,
which is optionally followed by a BibTeX file, having extension `.bib`,
a corresponding reStructuredText bibliography, having extension `.rst`,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension `.py`.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.,
{{{
{
'Nielsen:99': """
K. Nielsen. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
""",
'Larsen:86':
"""
O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
*Personal Press*. 1986.
"""
}
}}}
In the LaTeX format, the `.bib` file will be used in the standard way,
in the reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the `.rst` file will be
copied into the document at the place where the `BIBFILE:` keyword
appears, while all other formats will make use of the Python dictionary
typeset as an ordered Doconce list, replacing the `BIBFILE:` line
in the document.

At present, only one file with bibliographic references can be used.

<wiki:comment> see ketch/tex2rst for nice bibtex to rst converter which could </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> be used here </wiki:comment>

Conversion of BibTeX databases to reStructuredText format can be
done by the [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/ bibliograph.parsing] tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [1], a paper [2],
and both of them simultaneously [1] [2].

[somereader: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) ]

==== Tables ====

A table like


 ||      *time*       ||    *velocity*     ||  *acceleration*   ||
 ||  0.0              ||  1.4186           ||  -5.01            ||
 ||  2.0              ||  1.376512         ||  11.919           ||
 ||  4.0              ||  1.1E+1           ||  14.717624        ||


is built up of pipe symbols and dashes:
{{{
  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|
}}}
The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters `c`, `r`, or `l` to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes `|` can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (reStructuredText and Sphinx are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.

==== Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code ====

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" `!bc` keyword and an "end code" `!ec` keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  There may be an argument after the `!bc` tag to specify a
certain `ptex2tex` environment (for instance, `!bc dat` corresponds to
the data file environment in `ptex2tex`, and `!bc cod` is typically
used for a code snippet, but any argument can be defined). If there is
no argument, one assumes the ccq environment, which is plain LaTeX
verbatim in the default `.ptex2tex.cfg`. However, all these arguments
can be redefined in the `.ptex2tex.cfg` file.

The argument after `!bc` is also used
in a Sphinx context. Then argument is mapped onto a valid Pygments
language for typesetting of the verbatim block by Pygments. This
mapping takes place in an optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce
source file, e.g.,
{{{
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console
}}}
Here, three arguments are defined: `pycod` for Python code,
`cod` also for Python code, `cppcod` for C++ code, and `sys`
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in `.ptex2tex.cfg` for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, `pro` is used for complete programs in Python, `cod`
is for a code snippet in Python, while `xcod` and `xpro` implies
computer language specific typesetting where `x` can be
`f` for Fortran, `c` for C, `cpp` for C++, and `py` for Python.
The argument `sys` means by default `console` for Sphinx and
`CodeTerminal` (ptex2tex environent) for LaTeX. All these definitions
of the arguments after `!bc` can be redefined in the `.ptex2tex.cfg`
configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the `sphinx code-blocks`
comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages is easily added.

<wiki:comment> (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the </wiki:comment>
<wiki:comment> first one is used.) </wiki:comment>

The enclosing `!ec` tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (`pycod` style):
{{{
# regular expressions for inline tags:
inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
INLINE_TAGS = {
    'emphasize':
    r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'verbatim':
    r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
    'bold':
    r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
    (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
}
}}}
And here is a C++ code snippet (`cppcod` style):
{{{
void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
        myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
    }
}
}}}

Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then
{{{
 @@@CODE myfile.f
 @@@CODE myfile.f fromto:subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1
}}}
The first line implies that all lines in the file `myfile.f` are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a `!bc pro` environment.  The
second line has a `fromto:' directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc cod`
environment. (The `pro` and `cod` arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain `!bc` environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
`@` sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching `subroutine test`
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching `C END1` (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above):

{{{
C     a comment

      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return
C     END1

      program testme
      call test()
      return
}}}

Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the `fromto:`
directive above:

{{{
      subroutine    test()
      integer i
      real*8 r
      r = 0
      do i = 1, i
         r = r + i
      end do
      return

}}}

(Remark for those familiar with `ptex2tex`: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in `ptex2tex`. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
`.p.tex` file to be treated by `ptex2tex`. However, the `@@@CODE` line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by a *pro* or *cod* `ptex2tex`
environment.)

==== LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text ====

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is `!bt` (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
`!et`. It is important that `!bt` and `!et` appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.

Here is the result of a `!bt` - `!et` block:
{{{
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f,\label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{eqnarray}
}}}

This text looks ugly in all Doconce supported formats, except from
LaTeX and Sphinx.  If HTML is desired, the best is to filter the Doconce text
first to LaTeX and then use the widely available tex4ht tool to
convert the dvi file to HTML, or one could just link a PDF file (made
from LaTeX) directly from HTML. For other textual formats, it is best
to avoid blocks of mathematics and instead use inline mathematics
where it is possible to write expressions both in native LaTeX format
(so it looks good in LaTeX) and in a pure text format (so it looks
okay in other formats).

==== Macros (Newcommands) ====

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
`newcommand_replace.tex`:

{{{
\newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
\newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
\newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
\newcommand{\mathbfx}[1]{{\mbox{\boldmath $#1$}}}
\newcommand{\Q}{\mathbfx{Q}}
}}}

and these in `newcommands_keep.tex`:

{{{
\newcommand{\x}{\mathbfx{x}}
\newcommand{\normalvec}{\mathbfx{n}}
\newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}
}}}

The LaTeX block
{{{
\beqa
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep\label{my:eq2}
\eeqa
}}}
will then be rendered to
{{{
\begin{eqnarray}
\x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
\Ddt{\vec u} &=& {\mbox{\boldmath $Q$}} \thinspace . \label{my:eq2}
\end{eqnarray}
}}}
in the current format.

==== Preprocessing Steps ====

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(http://code.google.com/p/preprocess) and mako
(http://www.makotemplates.org/). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of `name=value` command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable `FORMAT`
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (`html`, `latex`,
`plain`, `rst`, `sphinx`, `epydoc`, `st`).  It is then easy to test on
the value of `FORMAT` and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example (see the Doconce
source code of this document to understand how preprocess is used to
create the example).

---------------------------------------------------------------




Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section [#From_Doconce_to_Other_Formats].

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.

==== Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces ====

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form `#include "file.do.txt"`.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reStructuredText and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate `.rst` files and an index file listing the various `.rst`
that build up the document. To generate the various `.rst` files one
should not run Doconce on the individual `.do.txt` files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script `doconce split_rst`
to split the long, complete `.rst` into pieces. This process requires
that each `#include "file.do.txt` line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax `#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>`, where
`file` is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword `part:`.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is `master.do.txt`.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run
{{{
doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake-sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi
}}}
The autogenerated `automake-sphinx.sh` file (by `doconce sphinx_dir`)
is compatible with a master `.rst` file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to `doconce sphinx_dir`.
This set is the output of `doconce split_rst`, which we catch in a
variable `files` above.

==== Missing Features ====

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, test on the
`FORMAT` variable (`#if FORMAT == "latex"`) in the Doconce code and
insert the table in LaTeX format. The `else` or `elif` branches may
have the table in other formats or a simplified version in the Doconce
table format. Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say
{{{
# table of contents
}}}
we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce `doconce format latex mydoc` to produce `mydoc.p.tex`. Then
we use the `doconce replace` and `doconce subst` commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:
{{{
Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
}}}
The `doconce replace from_text to_text filename` command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the `replace` method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with `\tableofcontents`, we should use `doconce subst`,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:
{{{
Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex
}}}
Note the double backshlash in front of the `t` character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The `doconce subst` is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

==== Header and Footer ====

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if `TITLE:` or
`#TITLE:` is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.



== Troubleshooting ==

==== Disclaimer ====

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running `doconce format`, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.

==== General Problems ====

==== Figure captions are incomplete ====

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

==== Preprocessor directives do not work ====

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

==== Problems with boldface and emphasize ====

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

==== Strange non-English characters ====

Check the encoding of the `.do.txt` file with the Unix `file` command
or with
{{{
Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt
}}}
If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands
{{{
Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile
}}}

==== Problems with Code or Tex Blocks ====

==== Code or TeX block errors in reST ====

Sometimes reStructuredText (reST) reports an "Unexpected indentation"
at the beginning of a code block. If you see a `!bc`, which should
have been removed by `doconce format`, it is usually an error in the
Doconce source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if
the line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a
question mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a
newline/space after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among
the mentioned. Then `!bc` will most likely be replaced and a double
colon at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in
reST to indicate a verbatim block of text).

==== Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST ====

If `idx` commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

==== Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly ====

Read the the section [#Blocks_of_Verbatim_Computer_Code] above.  Start the
`!bc` and `!ec` tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

==== LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly ====

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the `!bt` and `!et` tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.

==== Problems with reST Output ====

==== Lists do not appear in .rst files ====

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

==== Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST ====

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

==== Inconsistent headings in reST ====

The `rst2*.py` and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for `===`,
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

==== Problems with LaTeX Output ====

==== The LaTeX file does not compile ====

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
{{{
\code{...}
}}}
the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in backquotes in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

==== Problems with gwiki Output ====

==== Strange nested lists in gwiki ====

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the `.gwiki` file directly.

==== Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source ====

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

==== Debugging ====

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
`_doconce_debugging.log`, if the to `doconce format` after the filename
is `debug`. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



== Basic Parsing Ideas ==

<wiki:comment> avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea) </wiki:comment>

The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression

{{{
(?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?
}}}

That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reStructuredText and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reStructuredText or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.

==== A Glimpse of How to Write a New Translator ====

This is the HTML-specific part of the
source code of the HTML translator:


{{{
FILENAME_EXTENSION['html'] = '.html'  # output file extension
BLANKLINE['html'] = '<p>\n'           # blank input line => new paragraph
INLINE_TAGS_SUBST['html'] = {         # from inline tags to HTML tags
    # keep math as is:
    'math': None,  # indicates no substitution
    'emphasize':     r'\g<begin><em>\g<subst></em>\g<end>',
    'bold':          r'\g<begin><b>\g<subst></b>\g<end>',
    'verbatim':      r'\g<begin><tt>\g<subst></tt>\g<end>',
    'URL':           r'\g<begin><a href="\g<url>">\g<link></a>',
    'section':       r'<h1>\g<subst></h1>',
    'subsection':    r'<h3>\g<subst></h3>',
    'subsubsection': r'<h5>\g<subst></h5>',
    'paragraph':     r'<b>\g<subst></b>. ',
    'title':         r'<title>\g<subst></title>\n<center><h1>\g<subst></h1></center>',
    'date':          r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',

    }

    }

}}}

==== Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables ====

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that `argument`, `keyword argument`, `return`,
`instance variable`, `class variable`, and `module variable` are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted.

{{{
    - argument x: x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.
    - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
    - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
    - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
    - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
      (bool variable).
}}}

The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.


    * *module variable* x:  
      x value (float),      which must be a positive number.
    * *module variable* tolerance:  
      tolerance (float) for stopping      the iterations.

TITLE: Doconce Description
BY: Hans Petter Langtangen (Simula Research Laboratory, and University of Oslo)DATE: today
What Is Doconce?
Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)
 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  - Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown, Pandoc, and AsciiDoc, but less than reST, and very much
    less than LaTeX and HTML.
  - Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  - Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files.
  - Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  - Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  - Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  - Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, or MS Word.
    With "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex":ptex2tex, Doconce can
    display computer code in LaTeX in many sophisticated ways (almost
    50 styles are available).
  - Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  - Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    MS Word documents, in wikis, or as Sphinx documents.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting may face problems
when transformed to other formats.
Dependencies
If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either "http://code.google.com/p/preprocess":Preprocess or "http://www.makotemplates.org":Mako must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex":ptex2tex and some style
files that 'ptex2tex' potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires "http://docutils.sourceforge.net":docutils.  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course "http://sphinx.pocoo.org":Sphinx.
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/":Pandoc is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.
Demos
The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the::


        docs/manual/manual.do.txt

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
"https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html":demo web page
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file 'make.sh' in the same directory as the 'manual.do.txt' file
(the current text) shows how to run 'doconce format' on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

In the 'tutorial' directory there is also a 'make.sh' file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
"https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html":web demo
of the results.
From Doconce to Other Formats
Transformation of a Doconce document 'mydoc.do.txt' to various other
formats applies the script 'doconce format':
!bc   sys
        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The 'mako' or 'preprocess' programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to 'mako' or 'preprocess' can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable 'FORMAT' is always defined as the current format when
running 'preprocess'. That is, in the last example, 'FORMAT' is
defined as 'latex'. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like '#if FORMAT == "latex"'.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.
HTML
Making an HTML version of a Doconce file 'mydoc.do.txt'
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file 'mydoc.html' can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.
LaTeX
Making a LaTeX file 'mydoc.tex' from 'mydoc.do.txt' is done in two steps:

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form 'mydoc.p.tex' for
     'ptex2tex':
!bc   sys
        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files 'newcommands.tex', 'newcommands_keep.tex', or
'newcommands_replace.tex' (see the section "Macros (Newcommands)").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run 'ptex2tex' (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a '.p.tex' file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc

A separate titlepage can be generate by::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc


The 'ptex2tex' tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any '!bc' command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your '.ptex2tex.cfg'
file, e.g., '!bc cod' for a code snippet, where 'cod' is set to
a certain environment in '.ptex2tex.cfg' (e.g., 'CodeIntended').
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

*Step 3.* Compile 'mydoc.tex'
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the 'Minted_Python', 'Minted_Cpp', etc., environments
in 'ptex2tex' for typesetting code, the 'minted' LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running 'doconce format' with the
'-DMINTED' option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, 'latex' must be run with the
'-shell-escape' option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

The '-shell-escape' option is required because the 'minted.sty' style
file runs the 'pygments' program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from 'latex' without the '-shell-escape' option.
Plain ASCII Text
We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt

reStructuredText
Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file 'mydoc.rst':
!bc   sys
        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file 'mydoc.odt' can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.
Sphinx
Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the 'doconce sphinx_dir' command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords 'author', 'title', and 'version' are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, 'version' is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files 'file1',
'file2', etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files 'file1', 'file2', etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of 'dirname' is 'sphinx-rootdir'. The 'theme'
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is ''default'').

With a single-file document in 'mydoc.do.txt' one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory 'sphinx-rootdir' is made with
relevant files.

The 'doconce sphinx_dir' command generates a script
'automake-sphinx.sh' for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named 'figs' or 'figures'
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, 'automake-sphinx.sh' must be edited accordingly. One
can either run 'automake-sphinx.sh' or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the 'conf.py'
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
'make-themes.sh' can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes 'fenics' and 'pyramid', one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are '_build/html_fenics'
and '_build/html_pyramid', respectively. Without arguments,
'make-themes.sh' makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file 'mydoc.do.txt'.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory with a 'conf.py' file,
either manually or by using the interactive 'sphinx-quickstart'
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


*Step 3.* Copy the 'tutorial.rst' file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with 'mydoc.rst' in the 'sphinx-rootdir'
directory. Either edit 'mydoc.rst' so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to 'sphinx-rootdir'.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated 'index.rst' file so that 'mydoc.rst'
is included, i.e., add 'mydoc' to the 'toctree' section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before 'mydoc' are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows '!bc': 'cod' gives Python
('code-block:: python' in Sphinx syntax) and 'cppcod' gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.
Google Code Wiki
There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by "http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax":Google Code.
The transformation to this format, called 'gwiki' to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the 'mydoc.gwiki' output file from 'doconce format' and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press **Preview** or **Save Page** to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).
Tweaking the Doconce Output
Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
'.rst' file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if '.eps' or '.png' is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The 'make.sh' files in 'docs/manual' and 'docs/tutorial'
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.
The Doconce Markup Language
The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.
Lists
An unordered bullet list makes use of the '*' as bullet sign
and is indented as follows::


           * item 1
        
           * item 2
        
             * subitem 1, if there are more
               lines, each line must
               be intended as shown here
        
             * subitem 2,
               also spans two lines
        
           * item 3


This list gets typeset as

   - item 1
   - item 2
     - subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here
     - subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   - item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an 'o' (as the first letter
in "ordered")::


           o item 1
        
           o item 2
        
             * subitem 1
        
             * subitem 2
        
           o item 3


resulting in

  1. item 1
  2. item 2
     - subitem 1
     - subitem 2

  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon::


           - keyword1: explanation of keyword1
        
           - keyword2: explanation
             of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
             if there are multiple lines)


The result becomes

   keyword1: --

Special Lines
The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with 'TITLE:', 'AUTHOR:', and 'DATE:' are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax::


        name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3

The 'at' with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the 'and' with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
Multiple authors require multiple 'AUTHOR:' lines. All information
associated with 'TITLE:' and 'AUTHOR:' keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: November 9, 2016

Note the how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including reStructuredText and Sphinx)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format::


        Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
        Kaare Dump [3]
        A. Dummy Author
        
        [1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
        [2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
        [3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   - 7 underscores or equal signs for sections
   - 5 for subsections
   - 3 for subsubsections
   - 2 underscrores (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by blanks if desired.

Here are some examples::


        ======= Example on a Section Heading =======
        
        The running text goes here.
        
              ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
        The running text goes here.
        
                  ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        __A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.


The result for the present format looks like this:
Example on a Section Heading
The running text goes here.
Example on a Subsection Heading
The running text goes here.
Example on a Subsubsection Heading
The running text goes here.

*A Paragraph.* The running text goes here.
Special Lines
Figures
Figures are recognized by the special line syntax::


        FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say '.eps' when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's 'convert' utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for 'TITLE:' and 'AUTHOR:' lines, all information
related to a figure line must be written on the same line. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as 'FIGURE:' will be
included in the formatted caption).

FIGURE:[figs/streamtubes, width=400] Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. {fig:viz}
Movies
Here is an example on the 'MOVIE:' keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the 'latex', 'html', 'rst', and 'sphinx' formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie::


        MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption



 (Movie figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play "mjolnir.html":mjolnir.html)



The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the 'movie15' package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable 'MOVIE15'. There is an associated variable
'EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER' which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader)::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc


The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
'myframes*.png'. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the 'MOVIE:' command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).
Copying Computer Code from Source Files
Another type of special lines starts with '@@@CODE' and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" below.
Inline Tagging
Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, **boldface phrases**,
and 'verbatim text' (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x).

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in::


        *emphasized words*


Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk::


        _several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

The line above gets typeset as
**several words in boldface** followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between backquotes::


        `call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
        while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

The typesetting result looks like this:
'call myroutine(a, b)' looks like a Fortran call
while 'void myfunc(double *a, double *b)' must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and 'ptex2tex') will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing backquotes and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as::


        some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"

which appears as some URL like "http://google.com":Search Google.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in '.txt', '.html', or '.pdf' follows the same
setup::


        see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt"

which appears as see the "manual.do.txt":Doconce Manual.

Links to files with other extensions must be realized
*with the filename as link text*, written as
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes::


        URL: "manual.xml"

resulting in the link "manual.xml":manual.xml.

To have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes::


        Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

resulting in Click on this link: "http://code.google.com/p/doconce":http://code.google.com/p/doconce.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text::


        [name: comment]

where 'name' is the name of the author of the command, and 'comment' is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless 'doconce format'
is run with a command-line specification of removing such comments
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example). Inline comments
[hpl: Here is a specific example on an inline comment. It can
span several lines.]
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the '.do.txt' file
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats").

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Most formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX (Epytext has some
inline math support that is utilized).  However, mathematical
expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains special formatting
commands, which may appear annoying in plain text. Doconce therefore
supports an extended inline math syntax where the writer can provide
an alternative syntax suited for formats close to plain ASCII::


        Here is an example on a linear system
        ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
        where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
        $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in LaTeX, while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system Ax=b, where A
is an nxn matrix, and x and b
are vectors of length n."
Cross-Referencing
References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple::


        label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
        For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reStructuredText commands by 'doconce format'. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure ref{fig:viz}
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections "LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text" and "Macros (Newcommands)" are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section "Inline Tagging".
Index and Bibliography
An index can be created for the LaTeX and the reStructuredText or
Sphinx formats by the 'idx' keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax::


        idx{some index entry}
        idx{main entry!subentry}
        idx{`verbatim_text` and more}

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to::


        \index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: 'idx'
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reStructuredText and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style::


        as found in cite{Larsen:86,Nielsen:99}.

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding 'cite' command; in reStructuredText
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like::


        as found in [3][14]

if 'Larsen:86' has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and 'Nielsen:99' is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword 'BIBFILE:',
which is optionally followed by a BibTeX file, having extension '.bib',
a corresponding reStructuredText bibliography, having extension '.rst',
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension '.py'.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.::


        {
        'Nielsen:99': """
        K. Nielsen. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
        URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
        """,
        'Larsen:86':
        """
        O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
        *Personal Press*. 1986.
        """
        }

In the LaTeX format, the '.bib' file will be used in the standard way,
in the reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the '.rst' file will be
copied into the document at the place where the 'BIBFILE:' keyword
appears, while all other formats will make use of the Python dictionary
typeset as an ordered Doconce list, replacing the 'BIBFILE:' line
in the document.

At present, only one file with bibliographic references can be used.


Conversion of BibTeX databases to reStructuredText format can be
done by the "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/":bibliograph.parsing tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [1], a paper [2],
and both of them simultaneously [1] [2].

[somereader: comments, citations, and references in the latex style
is a special feature of doconce :-) ]
Tables
A table like

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters 'c', 'r', or 'l' to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes '|' can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (reStructuredText and Sphinx are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.
Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code
Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" '!bc' keyword and an "end code" '!ec' keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  There may be an argument after the '!bc' tag to specify a
certain 'ptex2tex' environment (for instance, '!bc dat' corresponds to
the data file environment in 'ptex2tex', and '!bc cod' is typically
used for a code snippet, but any argument can be defined). If there is
no argument, one assumes the ccq environment, which is plain LaTeX
verbatim in the default '.ptex2tex.cfg'. However, all these arguments
can be redefined in the '.ptex2tex.cfg' file.

The argument after '!bc' is also used
in a Sphinx context. Then argument is mapped onto a valid Pygments
language for typesetting of the verbatim block by Pygments. This
mapping takes place in an optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce
source file, e.g.::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

Here, three arguments are defined: 'pycod' for Python code,
'cod' also for Python code, 'cppcod' for C++ code, and 'sys'
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in '.ptex2tex.cfg' for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, 'pro' is used for complete programs in Python, 'cod'
is for a code snippet in Python, while 'xcod' and 'xpro' implies
computer language specific typesetting where 'x' can be
'f' for Fortran, 'c' for C, 'cpp' for C++, and 'py' for Python.
The argument 'sys' means by default 'console' for Sphinx and
'CodeTerminal' (ptex2tex environent) for LaTeX. All these definitions
of the arguments after '!bc' can be redefined in the '.ptex2tex.cfg'
configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the 'sphinx code-blocks'
comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages is easily added.


The enclosing '!ec' tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code ('pycod' style)::


        # regular expressions for inline tags:
        inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
        inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
        INLINE_TAGS = {
            'emphasize':
            r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'verbatim':
            r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'bold':
            r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
        }

And here is a C++ code snippet ('cppcod' style)::


        void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
            for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
                myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
            }
        }


Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then::


         @@@CODE myfile.f
         @@@CODE myfile.f fromto:subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

The first line implies that all lines in the file 'myfile.f' are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a '!bc pro' environment.  The
second line has a `fromto:' directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc cod`
environment. (The 'pro' and 'cod' arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain '!bc' environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
'@' sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching 'subroutine test'
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching 'C END1' (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above)::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the 'fromto:'
directive above::


              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        


(Remark for those familiar with 'ptex2tex': The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in 'ptex2tex'. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
'.p.tex' file to be treated by 'ptex2tex'. However, the '@@@CODE' line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by a *pro* or *cod* 'ptex2tex'
environment.)
LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text
Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is '!bt' (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
'!et'. It is important that '!bt' and '!et' appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.

Here is the result of a '!bt' - '!et' block::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f,\label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{eqnarray}


This text looks ugly in all Doconce supported formats, except from
LaTeX and Sphinx.  If HTML is desired, the best is to filter the Doconce text
first to LaTeX and then use the widely available tex4ht tool to
convert the dvi file to HTML, or one could just link a PDF file (made
from LaTeX) directly from HTML. For other textual formats, it is best
to avoid blocks of mathematics and instead use inline mathematics
where it is possible to write expressions both in native LaTeX format
(so it looks good in LaTeX) and in a pure text format (so it looks
okay in other formats).
Macros (Newcommands)
Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
'newcommand_replace.tex' are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names 'newcommands.tex' and
'newcommands_keep.tex' are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
'!bt' and '!et' in 'newcommands_keep.tex' to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
'newcommands_replace.tex' and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the 'newcommands*.tex' files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
'newcommand_replace.tex':

!bc  
        \newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
        \newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
        \newcommand{\mathbfx}[1]{{\mbox{\boldmath $#1$}}}
        \newcommand{\Q}{\mathbfx{Q}}


and these in 'newcommands_keep.tex':

!bc  
        \newcommand{\x}{\mathbfx{x}}
        \newcommand{\normalvec}{\mathbfx{n}}
        \newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}


The LaTeX block::


        \beqa
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep\label{my:eq2}
        \eeqa

will then be rendered to::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\vec u} &=& {\mbox{\boldmath $Q$}} \thinspace . \label{my:eq2}
        \end{eqnarray}

in the current format.
Preprocessing Steps
Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
("http://code.google.com/p/preprocess":http://code.google.com/p/preprocess) and mako
("http://www.makotemplates.org/":http://www.makotemplates.org/). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of 'name=value' command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable 'FORMAT'
defined as the desired output format of Doconce ('html', 'latex',
'plain', 'rst', 'sphinx', 'epydoc', 'st').  It is then easy to test on
the value of 'FORMAT' and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example (see the Doconce
source code of this document to understand how preprocess is used to
create the example).




FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.


Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section "From Doconce to Other Formats".

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.
Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces
Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form '#include "file.do.txt"'.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reStructuredText and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate '.rst' files and an index file listing the various '.rst'
that build up the document. To generate the various '.rst' files one
should not run Doconce on the individual '.do.txt' files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script 'doconce split_rst'
to split the long, complete '.rst' into pieces. This process requires
that each '#include "file.do.txt' line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax '#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>', where
'file' is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword 'part:'.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is 'master.do.txt'.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run::


        doconce format sphinx master
        # Split master.rst into parts
        # as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
        files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`
        
        dir=sphinxm-rootdir
        
        if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
          doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
                  version=1.0 theme=default $files
          sh automake-sphinx.sh
        else
          for file in $files; do
            cp $file.rst $dir
          done
          cd $dir
          make html
          cd ..
        fi

The autogenerated 'automake-sphinx.sh' file (by 'doconce sphinx_dir')
is compatible with a master '.rst' file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to 'doconce sphinx_dir'.
This set is the output of 'doconce split_rst', which we catch in a
variable 'files' above.
Missing Features
Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, test on the
'FORMAT' variable ('#if FORMAT == "latex"') in the Doconce code and
insert the table in LaTeX format. The 'else' or 'elif' branches may
have the table in other formats or a simplified version in the Doconce
table format. Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say::


        # table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce 'doconce format latex mydoc' to produce 'mydoc.p.tex'. Then
we use the 'doconce replace' and 'doconce subst' commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter::


        Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
                  '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

The 'doconce replace from_text to_text filename' command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the 'replace' method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with '\tableofcontents', we should use 'doconce subst',
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character::


        Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
                  '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

Note the double backshlash in front of the 't' character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The 'doconce subst' is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.
Header and Footer
Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if 'TITLE:' or
'#TITLE:' is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.
Troubleshooting
Disclaimer
Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running 'doconce format', the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.
General Problems
Figure captions are incomplete
If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.
Preprocessor directives do not work
Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.
Problems with boldface and emphasize
Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.
Strange non-English characters
Check the encoding of the '.do.txt' file with the Unix 'file' command
or with::


        Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands::


        Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
        Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile

Problems with Code or Tex Blocks
Code or TeX block errors in reST
Sometimes reStructuredText (reST) reports an "Unexpected indentation"
at the beginning of a code block. If you see a '!bc', which should
have been removed by 'doconce format', it is usually an error in the
Doconce source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if
the line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a
question mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a
newline/space after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among
the mentioned. Then '!bc' will most likely be replaced and a double
colon at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in
reST to indicate a verbatim block of text).
Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST
If 'idx' commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.
Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly
Read the the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" above.  Start the
'!bc' and '!ec' tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).
LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly
Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the '!bt' and '!et' tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.
Problems with reST Output
Lists do not appear in .rst files
Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.
Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST
This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.
Inconsistent headings in reST
The 'rst2*.py' and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for '===',
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.
Problems with LaTeX Output
The LaTeX file does not compile
If the problem is undefined control sequence involving::


        \code{...}

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in backquotes in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.
Problems with gwiki Output
Strange nested lists in gwiki
Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the '.gwiki' file directly.
Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source
Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.
Debugging
Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
'_doconce_debugging.log', if the to 'doconce format' after the filename
is 'debug'. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.
Basic Parsing Ideas
The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression::


        (?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?


That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reStructuredText and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reStructuredText or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.
A Glimpse of How to Write a New Translator
This is the HTML-specific part of the
source code of the HTML translator::


        FILENAME_EXTENSION['html'] = '.html'  # output file extension
        BLANKLINE['html'] = '<p>\n'           # blank input line => new paragraph
        INLINE_TAGS_SUBST['html'] = {         # from inline tags to HTML tags
            # keep math as is:
            'math': None,  # indicates no substitution
            'emphasize':     r'\g<begin><em>\g<subst></em>\g<end>',
            'bold':          r'\g<begin><b>\g<subst></b>\g<end>',
            'verbatim':      r'\g<begin><tt>\g<subst></tt>\g<end>',
            'URL':           r'\g<begin><a href="\g<url>">\g<link></a>',
            'section':       r'<h1>\g<subst></h1>',
            'subsection':    r'<h3>\g<subst></h3>',
            'subsubsection': r'<h5>\g<subst></h5>',
            'paragraph':     r'<b>\g<subst></b>. ',
            'title':         r'<title>\g<subst></title>\n<center><h1>\g<subst></h1></center>',
            'date':          r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',
            'author':        r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',
            }
        
        # how to replace code and latex blocks by html (<pre>) environment:
        def html_code(filestr):
            c = re.compile(r'^!bc(.*?)\n', re.MULTILINE)
            filestr = c.sub(r'<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK \g<1>-->\n<pre>\n', filestr)
            filestr = re.sub(r'!ec\n',
                             r'</pre>\n<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->\n', filestr)
            c = re.compile(r'^!bt\n', re.MULTILINE)
            filestr = c.sub(r'<pre>\n', filestr)
            filestr = re.sub(r'!et\n', r'</pre>\n', filestr)
            return filestr
        CODE['html'] = html_code
        
        # how to typeset lists and their items in html:
        LIST['html'] = {
            'itemize':

            'enumerate':
            {'begin': '\n<ol>\n', 'item': '<li>', 'end': '</ol>\n\n'},
            'description':
            {'begin': '\n<dl>\n', 'item': '<dt>%s<dd>', 'end': '</dl>\n\n'},
            }
        
        # how to type set description lists for function arguments, return
        # values, and module/class variables:
        ARGLIST['html'] = {
            'parameter': '<b>argument</b>',
            'keyword': '<b>keyword argument</b>',
            'return': '<b>return value(s)</b>',
            'instance variable': '<b>instance variable</b>',
            'class variable': '<b>class variable</b>',
            'module variable': '<b>module variable</b>',
            }
        
        # document start:
        INTRO['html'] = """
        <html>
        <body bgcolor="white">
        """
        # document ending:
        OUTRO['html'] = """
        </body>
        </html>
        """

Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables
As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that 'argument', 'keyword argument', 'return',
'instance variable', 'class variable', and 'module variable' are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted::


            - argument x: x value (float),
              which must be a positive number.
            - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
              the iterations.
            - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
            - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
            - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
            - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
              (bool variable).


The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    module variable x: --  
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    module variable tolerance: --  
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

TITLE: Doconce Description

What Is Doconce?
================


Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)
 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  - Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown, Pandoc, and AsciiDoc, but less than reST, and very much
    less than LaTeX and HTML.
  - Doconce can be converted to plain I{untagged} text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  - Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files.
  - Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  - Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.
  - Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  - Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, or MS Word.
    With U{ptex2tex<http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>}, Doconce can
    display computer code in LaTeX in many sophisticated ways (almost
    50 styles are available).
  - Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.
  - Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    MS Word documents, in wikis, or as Sphinx documents.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting may face problems
when transformed to other formats.



Dependencies
------------

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either U{Preprocess<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>} or U{Mako<http://www.makotemplates.org>} must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need U{ptex2tex<http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex>} and some style
files that C{ptex2tex} potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires U{docutils<http://docutils.sourceforge.net>}.  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course U{Sphinx<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>}.
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to U{Pandoc<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>} is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.




Demos
-----


The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the::


        docs/manual/manual.do.txt

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
U{demo web page<https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html>}
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file C{make.sh} in the same directory as the C{manual.do.txt} file
(the current text) shows how to run C{doconce format} on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

In the C{tutorial} directory there is also a C{make.sh} file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
U{web demo<https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html>}
of the results.



From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document C{mydoc.do.txt} to various other
formats applies the script C{doconce format}::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The C{mako} or C{preprocess} programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to C{mako} or C{preprocess} can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable C{FORMAT} is always defined as the current format when
running C{preprocess}. That is, in the last example, C{FORMAT} is
defined as C{latex}. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like C{#if FORMAT == "latex"}.

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file C{mydoc.do.txt}
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file C{mydoc.html} can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file C{mydoc.tex} from C{mydoc.do.txt} is done in two steps:

I{Step 1.} Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form C{mydoc.p.tex} for
     C{ptex2tex}::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files C{newcommands.tex}, C{newcommands_keep.tex}, or
C{newcommands_replace.tex} (see the section "Macros (Newcommands)").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

I{Step 2.} Run C{ptex2tex} (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a C{.p.tex} file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc

A separate titlepage can be generate by::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc


The C{ptex2tex} tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any C{!bc} command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your C{.ptex2tex.cfg}
file, e.g., C{!bc cod} for a code snippet, where C{cod} is set to
a certain environment in C{.ptex2tex.cfg} (e.g., C{CodeIntended}).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

I{Step 3.} Compile C{mydoc.tex}
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the C{Minted_Python}, C{Minted_Cpp}, etc., environments
in C{ptex2tex} for typesetting code, the C{minted} LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running C{doconce format} with the
C{-DMINTED} option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, C{latex} must be run with the
C{-shell-escape} option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

The C{-shell-escape} option is required because the C{minted.sty} style
file runs the C{pygments} program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from C{latex} without the C{-shell-escape} option.


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file C{mydoc.rst}::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file C{mydoc.odt} can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the C{doconce sphinx_dir} command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords C{author}, C{title}, and C{version} are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, C{version} is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files C{file1},
C{file2}, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files C{file1}, C{file2}, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of C{dirname} is C{sphinx-rootdir}. The C{theme}
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is C{'default'}).

With a single-file document in C{mydoc.do.txt} one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory C{sphinx-rootdir} is made with
relevant files.

The C{doconce sphinx_dir} command generates a script
C{automake-sphinx.sh} for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named C{figs} or C{figures}
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, C{automake-sphinx.sh} must be edited accordingly. One
can either run C{automake-sphinx.sh} or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the C{conf.py}
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
C{make-themes.sh} can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes C{fenics} and C{pyramid}, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are C{_build/html_fenics}
and C{_build/html_pyramid}, respectively. Without arguments,
C{make-themes.sh} makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file C{mydoc.do.txt}.

I{Step 1.} Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


I{Step 2.} Create a Sphinx root directory with a C{conf.py} file,
either manually or by using the interactive C{sphinx-quickstart}
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


I{Step 3.} Copy the C{tutorial.rst} file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with C{mydoc.rst} in the C{sphinx-rootdir}
directory. Either edit C{mydoc.rst} so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to C{sphinx-rootdir}.

I{Step 4.} Edit the generated C{index.rst} file so that C{mydoc.rst}
is included, i.e., add C{mydoc} to the C{toctree} section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before C{mydoc} are important!)

I{Step 5.} Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


I{Step 6.} View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows C{!bc}: C{cod} gives Python
(C{code-block:: python} in Sphinx syntax) and C{cppcod} gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Google Code Wiki
----------------

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by U{Google Code<http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax>}.
The transformation to this format, called C{gwiki} to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the C{mydoc.gwiki} output file from C{doconce format} and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press B{Preview} or B{Save Page} to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
C{.rst} file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if C{.eps} or C{.png} is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The C{make.sh} files in C{docs/manual} and C{docs/tutorial}
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



The Doconce Markup Language
===========================

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

Lists
-----

An unordered bullet list makes use of the C{*} as bullet sign
and is indented as follows::


           * item 1
        
           * item 2
        
             * subitem 1, if there are more
               lines, each line must
               be intended as shown here
        
             * subitem 2,
               also spans two lines
        
           * item 3


This list gets typeset as

   - item 1
   - item 2
     - subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here
     - subitem 2,
       also spans two lines

   - item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an C{o} (as the first letter
in "ordered")::


           o item 1
        
           o item 2
        
             * subitem 1
        
             * subitem 2
        
           o item 3


resulting in

  1. item 1
  2. item 2
     - subitem 1
     - subitem 2

  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon::


           - keyword1: explanation of keyword1
        
           - keyword2: explanation
             of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
             if there are multiple lines)


The result becomes

   - keyword1: 
     explanation of keyword1
   - keyword2: 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple lines)

Special Lines
-------------

The Doconce markup language has a concept called I{special lines}.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


I{Heading with Title and Author(s).} Lines starting with C{TITLE:}, C{AUTHOR:}, and C{DATE:} are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax::


        name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3

The C{at} with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the C{and} with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
Multiple authors require multiple C{AUTHOR:} lines. All information
associated with C{TITLE:} and C{AUTHOR:} keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: November 9, 2016

Note the how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including reStructuredText and Sphinx)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format::


        Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
        Kaare Dump [3]
        A. Dummy Author
        
        [1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
        [2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
        [3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.


I{Section Headings.} Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   - 7 underscores or equal signs for sections
   - 5 for subsections
   - 3 for subsubsections
   - 2 underscrores (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by blanks if desired.

Here are some examples::


        ======= Example on a Section Heading =======
        
        The running text goes here.
        
              ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
        The running text goes here.
        
                  ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        __A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.


The result for the present format looks like this:

Example on a Section Heading
============================

The running text goes here.

Example on a Subsection Heading
-------------------------------
The running text goes here.

Example on a Subsubsection Heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The running text goes here.

I{A Paragraph.} The running text goes here.

Special Lines
=============

Figures
-------

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax::


        FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say C{.eps} when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's C{convert} utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for C{TITLE:} and C{AUTHOR:} lines, all information
related to a figure line must be written on the same line. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as C{FIGURE:} will be
included in the formatted caption).

FIGURE:[figs/streamtubes, width=400] Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. {fig:viz}

Movies
------

Here is an example on the C{MOVIE:} keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the C{latex}, C{html}, C{rst}, and C{sphinx} formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie::


        MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption



 (Movie figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play U{mjolnir.html<mjolnir.html>})



The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the C{movie15} package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable C{MOVIE15}. There is an associated variable
C{EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER} which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader)::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc


The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
C{myframes*.png}. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the C{MOVIE:} command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



Copying Computer Code from Source Files
---------------------------------------

Another type of special lines starts with C{@@@CODE} and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" below.


Inline Tagging
--------------


Doconce supports tags for I{emphasized phrases}, B{boldface phrases},
and C{verbatim text} (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as M{v = sin(x)}.

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in::


        *emphasized words*


Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk::


        _several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

The line above gets typeset as
B{several words in boldface} followed by I{ephasized text}.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between backquotes::


        `call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
        while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

The typesetting result looks like this:
C{call myroutine(a, b)} looks like a Fortran call
while C{void myfunc(double *a, double *b)} must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and C{ptex2tex}) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing backquotes and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as::


        some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"

which appears as some URL like U{Search Google<http://google.com>}.
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in C{.txt}, C{.html}, or C{.pdf} follows the same
setup::


        see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt"

which appears as see the U{Doconce Manual<manual.do.txt>}.

Links to files with other extensions must be realized
I{with the filename as link text}, written as
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes::


        URL: "manual.xml"

resulting in the link U{manual.xml<manual.xml>}.

To have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes::


        Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

resulting in Click on this link: U{http://code.google.com/p/doconce<http://code.google.com/p/doconce>}.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text::


        [name: comment]

where C{name} is the name of the author of the command, and C{comment} is a
plain text text. [hpl: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized.]
The name and comment are visible in the output unless C{doconce format}
is run with a command-line specification of removing such comments
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example). Inline comments
[hpl: Here is a specific example on an inline comment. It can
span several lines.]
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the C{.do.txt} file
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats").

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Most formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX (Epytext has some
inline math support that is utilized).  However, mathematical
expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains special formatting
commands, which may appear annoying in plain text. Doconce therefore
supports an extended inline math syntax where the writer can provide
an alternative syntax suited for formats close to plain ASCII::


        Here is an example on a linear system
        ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
        where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
        $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in LaTeX, while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system M{Ax=b}, where M{A}
is an M{nxn} matrix, and M{x} and M{b}
are vectors of length M{n}."

Cross-Referencing
-----------------

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple::


        label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
        For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reStructuredText commands by C{doconce format}. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure ref{fig:viz}
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections "LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text" and "Macros (Newcommands)" are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section "Inline Tagging".

Index and Bibliography
----------------------

An index can be created for the LaTeX and the reStructuredText or
Sphinx formats by the C{idx} keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax::


        idx{some index entry}
        idx{main entry!subentry}
        idx{`verbatim_text` and more}

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to::


        \index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: C{idx}
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reStructuredText and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style::


        as found in cite{Larsen:86,Nielsen:99}.

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding C{cite} command; in reStructuredText
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like::


        as found in [3][14]

if C{Larsen:86} has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and C{Nielsen:99} is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword C{BIBFILE:},
which is optionally followed by a BibTeX file, having extension C{.bib},
a corresponding reStructuredText bibliography, having extension C{.rst},
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension C{.py}.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.::


        {
        'Nielsen:99': """
        K. Nielsen. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
        URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
        """,
        'Larsen:86':
        """
        O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
        *Personal Press*. 1986.
        """
        }

In the LaTeX format, the C{.bib} file will be used in the standard way,
in the reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the C{.rst} file will be
copied into the document at the place where the C{BIBFILE:} keyword
appears, while all other formats will make use of the Python dictionary
typeset as an ordered Doconce list, replacing the C{BIBFILE:} line
in the document.

At present, only one file with bibliographic references can be used.


Conversion of BibTeX databases to reStructuredText format can be
done by the U{bibliograph.parsing<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/>} tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [1], a paper [2],
and both of them simultaneously [1] [2].

is a special feature of doconce :-) ]


Tables
------

A table like

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters C{c}, C{r}, or C{l} to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes C{|} can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (reStructuredText and Sphinx are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code
--------------------------------

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" C{!bc} keyword and an "end code" C{!ec} keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and I{start at the beginning of the
line}.  There may be an argument after the C{!bc} tag to specify a
certain C{ptex2tex} environment (for instance, C{!bc dat} corresponds to
the data file environment in C{ptex2tex}, and C{!bc cod} is typically
used for a code snippet, but any argument can be defined). If there is
no argument, one assumes the ccq environment, which is plain LaTeX
verbatim in the default C{.ptex2tex.cfg}. However, all these arguments
can be redefined in the C{.ptex2tex.cfg} file.

The argument after C{!bc} is also used
in a Sphinx context. Then argument is mapped onto a valid Pygments
language for typesetting of the verbatim block by Pygments. This
mapping takes place in an optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce
source file, e.g.::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

Here, three arguments are defined: C{pycod} for Python code,
C{cod} also for Python code, C{cppcod} for C++ code, and C{sys}
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in C{.ptex2tex.cfg} for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, C{pro} is used for complete programs in Python, C{cod}
is for a code snippet in Python, while C{xcod} and C{xpro} implies
computer language specific typesetting where C{x} can be
C{f} for Fortran, C{c} for C, C{cpp} for C++, and C{py} for Python.
The argument C{sys} means by default C{console} for Sphinx and
C{CodeTerminal} (ptex2tex environent) for LaTeX. All these definitions
of the arguments after C{!bc} can be redefined in the C{.ptex2tex.cfg}
configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the C{sphinx code-blocks}
comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages is easily added.


The enclosing C{!ec} tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (C{pycod} style)::


        # regular expressions for inline tags:
        inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
        inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
        INLINE_TAGS = {
            'emphasize':
            r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'verbatim':
            r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'bold':
            r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
        }

And here is a C++ code snippet (C{cppcod} style)::


        void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
            for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
                myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
            }
        }


Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then::


         @@@CODE myfile.f
         @@@CODE myfile.f fromto:subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

The first line implies that all lines in the file C{myfile.f} are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a C{!bc pro} environment.  The
second line has a `fromto:' directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc cod`
environment. (The C{pro} and C{cod} arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain C{!bc} environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
C{@} sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching C{subroutine test}
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching C{C END1} (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above)::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the C{fromto:}
directive above::


              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        


(Remark for those familiar with C{ptex2tex}: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in C{ptex2tex}. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
C{.p.tex} file to be treated by C{ptex2tex}. However, the C{@@@CODE} line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by a I{pro} or I{cod} C{ptex2tex}
environment.)


LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text
---------------------------------

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is C{!bt} (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
C{!et}. It is important that C{!bt} and C{!et} appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.

Here is the result of a C{!bt} - C{!et} block::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



This text looks ugly in all Doconce supported formats, except from
LaTeX and Sphinx.  If HTML is desired, the best is to filter the Doconce text
first to LaTeX and then use the widely available tex4ht tool to
convert the dvi file to HTML, or one could just link a PDF file (made
from LaTeX) directly from HTML. For other textual formats, it is best
to avoid blocks of mathematics and instead use inline mathematics
where it is possible to write expressions both in native LaTeX format
(so it looks good in LaTeX) and in a pure text format (so it looks
okay in other formats).

Macros (Newcommands)
--------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style I{newcommand}
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
C{newcommand_replace.tex} are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names C{newcommands.tex} and
C{newcommands_keep.tex} are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
C{!bt} and C{!et} in C{newcommands_keep.tex} to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
C{newcommands_replace.tex} and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the C{newcommands*.tex} files I{must} appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

I{Example.} Suppose we have the following commands in
C{newcommand_replace.tex}::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



and these in C{newcommands_keep.tex}::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.



The LaTeX block::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


will then be rendered to::


            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


in the current format.

Preprocessing Steps
-------------------

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(U{http://code.google.com/p/preprocess<http://code.google.com/p/preprocess>}) and mako
(U{http://www.makotemplates.org/<http://www.makotemplates.org/>}). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of C{name=value} command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable C{FORMAT}
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (C{html}, C{latex},
C{plain}, C{rst}, C{sphinx}, C{epydoc}, C{st}).  It is then easy to test on
the value of C{FORMAT} and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example (see the Doconce
source code of this document to understand how preprocess is used to
create the example).




FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.


Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section "From Doconce to Other Formats".

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces
---------------------------------------

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form C{#include "file.do.txt"}.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reStructuredText and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate C{.rst} files and an index file listing the various C{.rst}
that build up the document. To generate the various C{.rst} files one
should not run Doconce on the individual C{.do.txt} files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script C{doconce split_rst}
to split the long, complete C{.rst} into pieces. This process requires
that each C{#include "file.do.txt} line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax C{#>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>}, where
C{file} is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword C{part:}.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is C{master.do.txt}.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run::


        doconce format sphinx master
        # Split master.rst into parts
        # as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
        files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`
        
        dir=sphinxm-rootdir
        
        if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
          doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
                  version=1.0 theme=default $files
          sh automake-sphinx.sh
        else
          for file in $files; do
            cp $file.rst $dir
          done
          cd $dir
          make html
          cd ..
        fi

The autogenerated C{automake-sphinx.sh} file (by C{doconce sphinx_dir})
is compatible with a master C{.rst} file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to C{doconce sphinx_dir}.
This set is the output of C{doconce split_rst}, which we catch in a
variable C{files} above.


Missing Features
----------------

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, test on the
C{FORMAT} variable (C{#if FORMAT == "latex"}) in the Doconce code and
insert the table in LaTeX format. The C{else} or C{elif} branches may
have the table in other formats or a simplified version in the Doconce
table format. Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say::


        # table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce C{doconce format latex mydoc} to produce C{mydoc.p.tex}. Then
we use the C{doconce replace} and C{doconce subst} commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter::


        Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
                  '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

The C{doconce replace from_text to_text filename} command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the C{replace} method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with C{\tableofcontents}, we should use C{doconce subst},
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character::



            NOTE: A verbatim block has been removed because
                  it causes problems for Epytext.


Note the double backshlash in front of the C{t} character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The C{doconce subst} is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

Header and Footer
-----------------

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if C{TITLE:} or
C{#TITLE:} is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


Troubleshooting
===============

Disclaimer
----------

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running C{doconce format}, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


General Problems
----------------

Figure captions are incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as I{one line}, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

Preprocessor directives do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

Problems with boldface and emphasize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

Strange non-English characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the encoding of the C{.do.txt} file with the Unix C{file} command
or with::


        Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands::


        Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
        Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile



Problems with Code or Tex Blocks
--------------------------------

Code or TeX block errors in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes reStructuredText (reST) reports an "Unexpected indentation"
at the beginning of a code block. If you see a C{!bc}, which should
have been removed by C{doconce format}, it is usually an error in the
Doconce source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if
the line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a
question mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a
newline/space after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among
the mentioned. Then C{!bc} will most likely be replaced and a double
colon at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in
reST to indicate a verbatim block of text).

Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If C{idx} commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" above.  Start the
C{!bc} and C{!ec} tags in column 1 of the file, and be careful with
indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).

LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
previous paragraph. Make sure the C{!bt} and C{!et} tags are in column 1
and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.


Problems with reST Output
-------------------------

Lists do not appear in .rst files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.

Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
Just ignore these error messages.

Inconsistent headings in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The C{rst2*.py} and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for C{===},
count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.

Problems with LaTeX Output
--------------------------

The LaTeX file does not compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the problem is undefined control sequence involving::


        \code{...}

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in backquotes in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

Problems with gwiki Output
--------------------------

Strange nested lists in gwiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the C{.gwiki} file directly.

Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

Debugging
---------

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
C{_doconce_debugging.log}, if the to C{doconce format} after the filename
is C{debug}. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



Basic Parsing Ideas
===================


The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression::


        (?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?


That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reStructuredText and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reStructuredText or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


A Glimpse of How to Write a New Translator
------------------------------------------

This is the HTML-specific part of the
source code of the HTML translator:

Note that for Epytext, code or LaTeX blocks that contain a newline
character (for example as in C{\nabla} in LaTeX), will lead to an
effect of the newline and generate error messages. Our remedy is
to remove such code blocks and provide a notice about the removal.
Eight here we only displacy a smaller snippet that Epytext can
treat properly::


        INLINE_TAGS_SUBST['html'] = {         # from inline tags to html tags
            # keep math as is:
            'math': None,  # indicates no substitution
            'emphasize':     r'\g<begin><em>\g<subst></em>\g<end>',
            'bold':          r'\g<begin><b>\g<subst></b>\g<end>',
            'verbatim':      r'\g<begin><tt>\g<subst></tt>\g<end>',
            'URL':           r'\g<begin><a href="\g<url>">\g<link></a>',
            }



Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and I{placed at the end of
the doc string}. Note that C{argument}, C{keyword argument}, C{return},
C{instance variable}, C{class variable}, and C{module variable} are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted::


            - argument x: x value (float),
              which must be a positive number.
            - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
              the iterations.
            - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
            - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
            - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
            - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
              (bool variable).


The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    @var x: 
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.
    @var tolerance: 
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

What Is Doconce?
================


Doconce is two things:

 1. Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)

 2. Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".

Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
    Markdown, Pandoc, and AsciiDoc, but less than reST, and very much
    less than LaTeX and HTML.

  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text,
    often desirable for computer programs and email.

  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
    directly from the source code files.

  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).

  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.

  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, or MS Word.
    With ptex2tex (http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex), Doconce can
    display computer code in LaTeX in many sophisticated ways (almost
    50 styles are available).

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    MS Word documents, in wikis, or as Sphinx documents.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting may face problems
when transformed to other formats.



Dependencies
------------

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either Preprocess (http://code.google.com/p/preprocess) or Mako (http://www.makotemplates.org) must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need ptex2tex (http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex) and some style
files that ptex2tex potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires docutils (http://docutils.sourceforge.net).  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org).
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to Pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) is desired,
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.




Demos
-----


The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the::


        docs/manual/manual.do.txt

file in the Doconce source code tree. We have made a
demo web page (https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html)
where you can compare the Doconce source with the output in many
different formats: HTML, LaTeX, plain text, etc.

The file make.sh in the same directory as the manual.do.txt file
(the current text) shows how to run doconce format on the
Doconce file to obtain documents in various formats.

Another demo is found in::


        docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt

In the tutorial directory there is also a make.sh file producing a
lot of formats, with a corresponding
web demo (https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/tutorial/index.html)
of the results.



From Doconce to Other Formats
=============================

Transformation of a Doconce document mydoc.do.txt to various other
formats applies the script doconce format::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc.do.txt

or just::


        Terminal> doconce format format mydoc

The mako or preprocess programs are always used to preprocess the
file first, and options to mako or preprocess can be added after the
filename. For example::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc -Dextra_sections -DVAR1=5     # preprocess
        Terminal> doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako

The variable FORMAT is always defined as the current format when
running preprocess. That is, in the last example, FORMAT is
defined as latex. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like #if FORMAT == "latex".

Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc remove_inline_comments

One can also remove such comments from the original Doconce file
by running
source code::


        Terminal> doconce remove_inline_comments mydoc

This action is convenient when a Doconce document reaches its final form
and comments by different authors should be removed.


HTML
----

Making an HTML version of a Doconce file mydoc.do.txt
is performed by::


        Terminal> doconce format html mydoc

The resulting file mydoc.html can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.

LaTeX
-----

Making a LaTeX file mydoc.tex from mydoc.do.txt is done in two steps:

*Step 1.* Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form mydoc.p.tex for
     ptex2tex::


        Terminal> doconce format latex mydoc

LaTeX-specific commands ("newcommands") in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files newcommands.tex, newcommands_keep.tex, or
newcommands_replace.tex (see the section "Macros (Newcommands)").
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.

*Step 2.* Run ptex2tex (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file::


        Terminal> ptex2tex mydoc

or just perform a plain copy::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.p.tex mydoc.tex

Doconce generates a .p.tex file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc

The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX "maketitle" heading
is also available through::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional mydoc

A separate titlepage can be generate by::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage mydoc


The ptex2tex tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any !bc command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your .ptex2tex.cfg
file, e.g., !bc cod for a code snippet, where cod is set to
a certain environment in .ptex2tex.cfg (e.g., CodeIntended).
There are over 30 styles to choose from.

*Step 3.* Compile mydoc.tex
and create the PDF file::


        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

If one wishes to use the Minted_Python, Minted_Cpp, etc., environments
in ptex2tex for typesetting code, the minted LaTeX package is needed.
This package is included by running doconce format with the
-DMINTED option::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc

In this case, latex must be run with the
-shell-escape option::


        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> makeindex mydoc   # if index
        Terminal> bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
        Terminal> latex -shell-escape mydoc
        Terminal> dvipdf mydoc

The -shell-escape option is required because the minted.sty style
file runs the pygments program to format code, and this program
cannot be run from latex without the -shell-escape option.


Plain ASCII Text
----------------

We can go from Doconce "back to" plain untagged text suitable for viewing
in terminal windows, inclusion in email text, or for insertion in
computer source code::


        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc.do.txt  # results in mydoc.txt


reStructuredText
----------------

Going from Doconce to reStructuredText gives a lot of possibilities to
go to other formats. First we filter the Doconce text to a
reStructuredText file mydoc.rst::


        Terminal> doconce format rst mydoc.do.txt

We may now produce various other formats::


        Terminal> rst2html.py  mydoc.rst > mydoc.html # html
        Terminal> rst2latex.py mydoc.rst > mydoc.tex  # latex
        Terminal> rst2xml.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.xml  # XML
        Terminal> rst2odt.py   mydoc.rst > mydoc.odt  # OpenOffice

The OpenOffice file mydoc.odt can be loaded into OpenOffice and
saved in, among other things, the RTF format or the Microsoft Word format.
That is, one can easily go from Doconce to Microsoft Word.

Sphinx
------

Sphinx documents demand quite some steps in their creation. We have automated
most of the steps through the doconce sphinx_dir command::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir author="authors' names" \
                  title="some title" version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
                  theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...

The keywords author, title, and version are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, version is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files file1,
file2, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files file1, file2, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of dirname is sphinx-rootdir. The theme
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is 'default').

With a single-file document in mydoc.do.txt one often just runs::


        Terminal> doconce sphinx_dir mydoc

and then an appropriate Sphinx directory sphinx-rootdir is made with
relevant files.

The doconce sphinx_dir command generates a script
automake-sphinx.sh for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  This script copies directories named figs or figures
over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible in the
Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, automake-sphinx.sh must be edited accordingly. One
can either run automake-sphinx.sh or perform the steps in the
script manually.

Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the conf.py
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
make-themes.sh can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes fenics and pyramid, one writes::


        Terminal> ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid

The resulting directories with HTML documents are _build/html_fenics
and _build/html_pyramid, respectively. Without arguments,
make-themes.sh makes all available themes (!).

If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here are the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file mydoc.do.txt.

*Step 1.* Translate Doconce into the Sphinx dialect of
the reStructuredText format::


        Terminal> doconce format sphinx mydoc


*Step 2.* Create a Sphinx root directory with a conf.py file,
either manually or by using the interactive sphinx-quickstart
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter::


        mkdir sphinx-rootdir
        sphinx-quickstart <<EOF
        sphinx-rootdir
        n
        _
        Name of My Sphinx Document
        Author
        version
        version
        .rst
        index
        n
        y
        n
        n
        n
        n
        y
        n
        n
        y
        y
        y
        EOF


*Step 3.* Copy the tutorial.rst file to the Sphinx root directory::


        Terminal> cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir

If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with mydoc.rst in the sphinx-rootdir
directory. Either edit mydoc.rst so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to sphinx-rootdir.

*Step 4.* Edit the generated index.rst file so that mydoc.rst
is included, i.e., add mydoc to the toctree section so that it becomes::


        .. toctree::
           :maxdepth: 2
        
           mydoc

(The spaces before mydoc are important!)

*Step 5.* Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source::


        make clean   # remove old versions
        make html


*Step 6.* View the result::


        Terminal> firefox _build/html/index.html


Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows !bc: cod gives Python
(code-block:: python in Sphinx syntax) and cppcod gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.


Google Code Wiki
----------------

There are several different wiki dialects, but Doconce only support the
one used by Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax).
The transformation to this format, called gwiki to explicitly mark
it as the Google Code dialect, is done by::


        Terminal> doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

You can then open a new wiki page for your Google Code project, copy
the mydoc.gwiki output file from doconce format and paste the
file contents into the wiki page. Press _Preview_ or _Save Page_ to
see the formatted result.

When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must be
replaced by a URL where the figure is available. There are instructions
in the file for doing this. Usually, one performs this substitution
automatically (see next section).


Tweaking the Doconce Output
---------------------------

Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
.rst file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if .eps or .png is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The make.sh files in docs/manual and docs/tutorial
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.



The Doconce Markup Language
===========================

The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:
lists, special lines, inline tags, and environments.

Lists
-----

An unordered bullet list makes use of the * as bullet sign
and is indented as follows::


           * item 1
        
           * item 2
        
             * subitem 1, if there are more
               lines, each line must
               be intended as shown here
        
             * subitem 2,
               also spans two lines
        
           * item 3


This list gets typeset as

   * item 1

   * item 2

     * subitem 1, if there are more
       lines, each line must
       be intended as shown here

     * subitem 2,
       also spans two lines


   * item 3

In an ordered list, each item starts with an o (as the first letter
in "ordered")::


           o item 1
        
           o item 2
        
             * subitem 1
        
             * subitem 2
        
           o item 3


resulting in

  1. item 1

  2. item 2

     * subitem 1

     * subitem 2


  3. item 3

Ordered lists cannot have an ordered sublist, i.e., the ordering
applies to the outer list only.

In a description list, each item is recognized by a dash followed
by a keyword followed by a colon::


           - keyword1: explanation of keyword1
        
           - keyword2: explanation
             of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
             if there are multiple lines)


The result becomes

   keyword1: 
     explanation of keyword1

   keyword2: 
     explanation
     of keyword2 (remember to indent properly
     if there are multiple lines)

Special Lines
-------------

The Doconce markup language has a concept called *special lines*.
Such lines starts with a markup at the very beginning of the
line and are used to mark document title, authors, date,
sections, subsections, paragraphs., figures, movies, etc.


*Heading with Title and Author(s).* Lines starting with TITLE:, AUTHOR:, and DATE: are optional and used
to identify a title of the document, the authors, and the date. The
title is treated as the rest of the line, so is the date, but the
author text consists of the name and associated institution(s) with
the syntax::


        name at institution1 and institution2 and institution3

The at with surrounding spaces
is essential for adding information about institution(s)
to the author name, and the and with surrounding spaces is
essential as delimiter between different institutions.
Multiple authors require multiple AUTHOR: lines. All information
associated with TITLE: and AUTHOR: keywords must appear on a single
line.  Here is an example::


        TITLE: On an Ultimate Markup Language
        AUTHOR: H. P. Langtangen at Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory and Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo
        AUTHOR: Kaare Dump at Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.
        AUTHOR: A. Dummy Author
        DATE: November 9, 2016

Note the how one can specify a single institution, multiple institutions,
and no institution. In some formats (including reStructuredText and Sphinx)
only the author names appear. Some formats have
"intelligence" in listing authors and institutions, e.g., the plain text
format::


        Hans Petter Langtangen [1, 2]
        Kaare Dump [3]
        A. Dummy Author
        
        [1] Center for Biomedical Computing, Simula Research Laboratory
        [2] Department of Informatics, University of Oslo
        [3] Segfault, Cyberspace Inc.

Similar typesetting is done for LaTeX and HTML formats.


*Section Headings.* Section headings are recognized by being surrounded by equal signs (=) or
underscores before and after the text of the headline. Different
section levels are recognized by the associated number of underscores
or equal signs (=):

   * 7 underscores or equal signs for sections

   * 5 for subsections

   * 3 for subsubsections

   * 2 underscrores (only! - it looks best) for paragraphs
     (paragraph heading will be inlined)

Headings can be surrounded by blanks if desired.

Here are some examples::


        ======= Example on a Section Heading =======
        
        The running text goes here.
        
              ===== Example on a Subsection Heading =====
        The running text goes here.
        
                  ===Example on a Subsubsection Heading===
        
        The running text goes here.
        
        __A Paragraph.__ The running text goes here.


The result for the present format looks like this:

Example on a Section Heading
============================

The running text goes here.

Example on a Subsection Heading
-------------------------------
The running text goes here.

Example on a Subsubsection Heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The running text goes here.

*A Paragraph.* The running text goes here.

Special Lines
=============

Figures
-------

Figures are recognized by the special line syntax::


        FIGURE:[filename, height=xxx width=yyy scale=zzz] possible caption

The filename can be without extension, and Doconce will search for an
appropriate file with the right extension. If the extension is wrong,
say .eps when requesting an HTML format, Doconce tries to find another
file, and if not, the given file is converted to a proper format
(using ImageMagick's convert utility).

The height, width, and scale keywords (and others) can be included
if desired and may have effect for some formats. Note the comma
between the sespecifications and that there should be no space
around the = sign.

Note also that, like for TITLE: and AUTHOR: lines, all information
related to a figure line must be written on the same line. Introducing
newlines in a long caption will destroy the formatting (only the
part of the caption appearing on the same line as FIGURE: will be
included in the formatted caption).

FIGURE:[figs/streamtubes, width=400] Streamtube visualization of a fluid flow. {fig:viz}

Movies
------

Here is an example on the MOVIE: keyword for embedding movies. This
feature works well for the latex, html, rst, and sphinx formats.
Other formats try to generate some HTML file and link to that file
for showing the movie::


        MOVIE: [filename, height=xxx width=yyy] possible caption



 (Movie figs/mjolnir.mpeg: play mjolnir.html)



The LaTeX format results in a file that can either make use of
the movie15 package (requires the PDF to be shown in Acrobat Reader)
or just a plain address to the movie. The HTML, reST, and
Sphinx formats will play
the movie right away by embedding the file in a standard HTML code,
provided the output format is HTML.
For all other formats a URL to an HTML file, which can play the code,
is inserted in the output document.

When movies are embedded in the PDF file via LaTeX and
the movie15 package wanted, one has to turn on the preprocessor
variable MOVIE15. There is an associated variable
EXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER which can be defined to launch an external
viewer when displaying the PDF file (in Acrobat Reader)::


        Terminal> ptex2tex -DMOVIE15 -DEXTERNAL_MOVIE_VIEWER mydoc


The HTML, reST, and Sphinx formats can also treat filenames of the form
myframes*.png. In that case, an HTML file for showing the sequence of frames
is generated, and a link to this file is inserted in the output document.
That is, a simple "movie viewer" for the frames is made.

Many publish their scientific movies on YouTube, and Doconce recognizes
YouTube URLs as movies. When the output is an HTML file, the movie will
be embedded, otherwise a URL to the YouTube page is inserted.
You should equip the MOVIE: command with the right width and height
of embedded YouTube movies (the parameters appear when you request
the embedded HTML code for the movie on the YouTube page).



Copying Computer Code from Source Files
---------------------------------------

Another type of special lines starts with @@@CODE and enables copying
of computer code from a file directly into a verbatim environment, see
the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" below.


Inline Tagging
--------------


Doconce supports tags for *emphasized phrases*, _boldface phrases_,
and verbatim text (also called type writer text, for inline code)
plus LaTeX/TeX inline mathematics, such as v = sin(x).

Emphasized text is typeset inside a pair of asterisk, and there should
be no spaces between an asterisk and the emphasized text, as in::


        *emphasized words*


Boldface font is recognized by an underscore instead of an asterisk::


        _several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

The line above gets typeset as
_several words in boldface_ followed by *ephasized text*.

Verbatim text, typically used for short inline code,
is typeset between backquotes::


        `call myroutine(a, b)` looks like a Fortran call
        while `void myfunc(double *a, double *b)` must be C.

The typesetting result looks like this:
call myroutine(a, b) looks like a Fortran call
while void myfunc(double *a, double *b) must be C.

It is recommended to have inline verbatim text on the same line in
the Doconce file, because some formats (LaTeX and ptex2tex) will have
problems with inline verbatim text that is split over two lines.

Watch out for mixing backquotes and asterisk (i.e., verbatim and
emphasized code): the Doconce interpreter is not very smart so inline
computer code can soon lead to problems in the final format. Go back to the
Doconce source and modify it so the format to which you want to go
becomes correct (sometimes a trial and error process - sticking to
very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).

Web addresses with links are typeset as::


        some URL like "Doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"

which appears as some URL like Search Google (http://google.com).
The space after colon is optional.
Links to files ending in .txt, .html, or .pdf follows the same
setup::


        see the "Doconce Manual": "manual.do.txt"

which appears as see the Doconce Manual (manual.do.txt).

Links to files with other extensions must be realized
*with the filename as link text*, written as
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes::


        URL: "manual.xml"

resulting in the link manual.xml.

To have the URL address itself as link text, put an "URL" or URL
before the address enclosed in double quotes::


        Click on this link: URL:"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".

resulting in Click on this link: http://code.google.com/p/doconce.

Doconce also supports inline comments in the text::


        [name: comment]

where name is the name of the author of the command, and comment is a
plain text text. The name and comment are visible in the output unless doconce format
is run with a command-line specification of removing such comments
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats" for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the .do.txt file
(see the chapter "From Doconce to Other Formats").

Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Most formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX (Epytext has some
inline math support that is utilized).  However, mathematical
expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains special formatting
commands, which may appear annoying in plain text. Doconce therefore
supports an extended inline math syntax where the writer can provide
an alternative syntax suited for formats close to plain ASCII::


        Here is an example on a linear system
        ${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
        where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
        $\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.

That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in LaTeX, while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as "Here is an example
on a linear system Ax=b, where A
is an nxn matrix, and x and b
are vectors of length n."

Cross-Referencing
-----------------

References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple::


        label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
        For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.

This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the end effect is the same, but
the "label" and "ref" commands are first translated to the proper
reStructuredText commands by doconce format. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX "label" and "ref" are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.

It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure ref{fig:viz}
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections "LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text" and "Macros (Newcommands)" are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.

Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section "Inline Tagging".

Index and Bibliography
----------------------

An index can be created for the LaTeX and the reStructuredText or
Sphinx formats by the idx keyword, following a LaTeX-inspired syntax::


        idx{some index entry}
        idx{main entry!subentry}
        idx{`verbatim_text` and more}

The exclamation mark divides a main entry and a subentry. Backquotes
surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to::


        \index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}

Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: idx
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reStructuredText and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).

Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style::


        as found in cite{Larsen:86,Nielsen:99}.

Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding cite command; in reStructuredText
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like::


        as found in [3][14]

if Larsen:86 has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and Nielsen:99 is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.

The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword BIBFILE:,
which is optionally followed by a BibTeX file, having extension .bib,
a corresponding reStructuredText bibliography, having extension .rst,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension .py.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.::


        {
        'Nielsen:99': """
        K. Nielsen. *Some Comments on Markup Languages*.
        URL:"http://some.where.net/nielsen/comments", 1999.
        """,
        'Larsen:86':
        """
        O. B. Larsen. On Markup and Generality.
        *Personal Press*. 1986.
        """
        }

In the LaTeX format, the .bib file will be used in the standard way,
in the reStructuredText and Sphinx formats, the .rst file will be
copied into the document at the place where the BIBFILE: keyword
appears, while all other formats will make use of the Python dictionary
typeset as an ordered Doconce list, replacing the BIBFILE: line
in the document.

At present, only one file with bibliographic references can be used.


Conversion of BibTeX databases to reStructuredText format can be
done by the bibliograph.parsing (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bibliograph.parsing/) tool.

Finally, we here test the citation command and bibliography by
citing a book [1], a paper [2],
and both of them simultaneously [1] [2].

Tables
------

A table like

============  ============  ============  
    time        velocity    acceleration  
============  ============  ============  
         0.0        1.4186         -5.01  
         2.0      1.376512        11.919  
         4.0        1.1E+1     14.717624  
============  ============  ============  

is built up of pipe symbols and dashes::


          |--------------------------------|
          |time  | velocity | acceleration |
          |--------------------------------|
          | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
          | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
          | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
          |--------------------------------|

The pipes and column values do not need to be aligned (but why write
the Doconce source in an ugly way?). In the line below the heading,
one can insert the characters c, r, or l to specify the
alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to
algn the headings. Pipes | can also be inserted to indicate
vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (reStructuredText and Sphinx are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor
headings can span several columns or rows. When that functionality
is needed, one can make use of the preprocessor and if-tests on
the format and insert format-specific code for tables.



Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code
--------------------------------

Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
"begin code" !bc keyword and an "end code" !ec keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and *start at the beginning of the
line*.  There may be an argument after the !bc tag to specify a
certain ptex2tex environment (for instance, !bc dat corresponds to
the data file environment in ptex2tex, and !bc cod is typically
used for a code snippet, but any argument can be defined). If there is
no argument, one assumes the ccq environment, which is plain LaTeX
verbatim in the default .ptex2tex.cfg. However, all these arguments
can be redefined in the .ptex2tex.cfg file.

The argument after !bc is also used
in a Sphinx context. Then argument is mapped onto a valid Pygments
language for typesetting of the verbatim block by Pygments. This
mapping takes place in an optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce
source file, e.g.::


        # sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console

Here, three arguments are defined: pycod for Python code,
cod also for Python code, cppcod for C++ code, and sys
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in .ptex2tex.cfg for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).

By default, pro is used for complete programs in Python, cod
is for a code snippet in Python, while xcod and xpro implies
computer language specific typesetting where x can be
f for Fortran, c for C, cpp for C++, and py for Python.
The argument sys means by default console for Sphinx and
CodeTerminal (ptex2tex environent) for LaTeX. All these definitions
of the arguments after !bc can be redefined in the .ptex2tex.cfg
configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the sphinx code-blocks
comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages is easily added.


The enclosing !ec tag of verbatim computer code blocks must
be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In
general, we recommend to use paragraph headings instead of list items
in combination with code blocks (it usually looks better, and some
common errors are naturally avoided).

Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (pycod style)::


        # regular expressions for inline tags:
        inline_tag_begin = r'(?P<begin>(^|\s+))'
        inline_tag_end = r'(?P<end>[.,?!;:)\s])'
        INLINE_TAGS = {
            'emphasize':
            r'%s\*(?P<subst>[^ `][^*`]*)\*%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'verbatim':
            r'%s`(?P<subst>[^ ][^`]*)`%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
            'bold':
            r'%s_(?P<subst>[^ `][^_`]*)_%s' % \
            (inline_tag_begin, inline_tag_end),
        }

And here is a C++ code snippet (cppcod style)::


        void myfunc(double* x, const double& myarr) {
            for (int i = 1; i < myarr.size(); i++) {
                myarr[i] = myarr[i] - x[i]*myarr[i-1]
            }
        }


Computer code can be copied directly from a file, if desired. The syntax
is then::


         @@@CODE myfile.f
         @@@CODE myfile.f fromto:subroutine\s+test@^C\s{5}END1

The first line implies that all lines in the file myfile.f are
copied into a verbatim block, typset in a !bc pro environment.  The
second line has a `fromto:' directive, which implies copying code
between two lines in the code, typset within a !`bc cod`
environment. (The pro and cod arguments are only used for LaTeX
and Sphinx output, all other formats will have the code typeset within
a plain !bc environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
@ sign, define the "from" and "to" lines.  The "from" line is
included in the verbatim block, while the "to" line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching subroutine test
(with as many blanks as desired between the two words) and the line
matching C END1 (C followed by 5 blanks and then the text END1). The
final line with the "to" text is not included in the verbatim block.

Let us copy a whole file (the first line above)::


        C     a comment
        
              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        C     END1
        
              program testme
              call test()
              return


Let us then copy just a piece in the middle as indicated by the fromto:
directive above::


              subroutine    test()
              integer i
              real*8 r
              r = 0
              do i = 1, i
                 r = r + i
              end do
              return
        


(Remark for those familiar with ptex2tex: The from-to
syntax is slightly different from that used in ptex2tex. When
transforming Doconce to LaTeX, one first transforms the document to a
.p.tex file to be treated by ptex2tex. However, the @@@CODE line
is interpreted by Doconce and replaced by a *pro* or *cod* ptex2tex
environment.)


LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text
---------------------------------

Blocks of mathematical text are like computer code blocks, but
the opening tag is !bt (begin TeX) and the closing tag is
!et. It is important that !bt and !et appear on the beginning of the
line and followed by a newline.

Here is the result of a !bt - !et block::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        {\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f,\label{myeq1}\\
        {\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
        \end{eqnarray}


This text looks ugly in all Doconce supported formats, except from
LaTeX and Sphinx.  If HTML is desired, the best is to filter the Doconce text
first to LaTeX and then use the widely available tex4ht tool to
convert the dvi file to HTML, or one could just link a PDF file (made
from LaTeX) directly from HTML. For other textual formats, it is best
to avoid blocks of mathematics and instead use inline mathematics
where it is possible to write expressions both in native LaTeX format
(so it looks good in LaTeX) and in a pure text format (so it looks
okay in other formats).

Macros (Newcommands)
--------------------

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
newcommand_replace.tex are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names newcommands.tex and
newcommands_keep.tex are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by::

least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
newcommands_replace.tex and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the newcommands*.tex files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

*Example.* Suppose we have the following commands in
newcommand_replace.tex::


        \newcommand{\beqa}{\begin{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\eeqa}{\end{eqnarray}}
        \newcommand{\ep}{\thinspace . }
        \newcommand{\uvec}{\vec u}
        \newcommand{\mathbfx}[1]{{\mbox{\boldmath $#1$}}}
        \newcommand{\Q}{\mathbfx{Q}}


and these in newcommands_keep.tex::


        \newcommand{\x}{\mathbfx{x}}
        \newcommand{\normalvec}{\mathbfx{n}}
        \newcommand{\Ddt}[1]{\frac{D#1}{dt}}


The LaTeX block::


        \beqa
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\uvec} &=& \Q \ep\label{my:eq2}
        \eeqa

will then be rendered to::

        \begin{eqnarray}
        \x\cdot\normalvec &=& 0,\label{my:eq1}\\
        \Ddt{\vec u} &=& {\mbox{\boldmath $Q$}} \thinspace . \label{my:eq2}
        \end{eqnarray}

in the current format.

Preprocessing Steps
-------------------

Doconce allows preprocessor commands for, e.g., including files,
leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(http://code.google.com/p/preprocess) and mako
(http://www.makotemplates.org/). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of name=value command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.

Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.

The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable FORMAT
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (html, latex,
plain, rst, sphinx, epydoc, st).  It is then easy to test on
the value of FORMAT and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example (see the Doconce
source code of this document to understand how preprocess is used to
create the example).




FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0001.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.1 s.

FIGURE:[figs/wavepacket_0010.png, width=400] Wavepacket at time 0.2 s.


Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section "From Doconce to Other Formats".

More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.



Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces
---------------------------------------

Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form #include "file.do.txt".
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.

For reStructuredText and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate .rst files and an index file listing the various .rst
that build up the document. To generate the various .rst files one
should not run Doconce on the individual .do.txt files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script doconce split_rst
to split the long, complete .rst into pieces. This process requires
that each #include "file.do.txt line in the master file is preceded by a
"marker line" having the syntax #>>>>>> part: file >>>>>>, where
file is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword part:.

Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is master.do.txt.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run::


        doconce format sphinx master
        # Split master.rst into parts
        # as defined by #>>>>> part: name >>>>> lines
        files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`
        
        dir=sphinxm-rootdir
        
        if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
          doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
                  version=1.0 theme=default $files
          sh automake-sphinx.sh
        else
          for file in $files; do
            cp $file.rst $dir
          done
          cd $dir
          make html
          cd ..
        fi

The autogenerated automake-sphinx.sh file (by doconce sphinx_dir)
is compatible with a master .rst file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to doconce sphinx_dir.
This set is the output of doconce split_rst, which we catch in a
variable files above.


Missing Features
----------------

Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, test on the
FORMAT variable (#if FORMAT == "latex") in the Doconce code and
insert the table in LaTeX format. The else or elif branches may
have the table in other formats or a simplified version in the Doconce
table format. Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).

Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.

As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say::


        # table of contents

we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce doconce format latex mydoc to produce mydoc.p.tex. Then
we use the doconce replace and doconce subst commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter::


        Terminal> doconce replace '% table of contents'
                  '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

The doconce replace from_text to_text filename command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the replace method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with \tableofcontents, we should use doconce subst,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character::


        Terminal> doconce subst '% table of contents' \
                  '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex

Note the double backshlash in front of the t character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The doconce subst is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.

Header and Footer
-----------------

Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if TITLE: or
#TITLE: is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.


Troubleshooting
===============

Disclaimer
----------

Doconce has some support for syntax checking.  If you encounter Python
errors while running doconce format, the reason for the error is
most likely a syntax problem in your Doconce source file. You have to
track down this syntax problem yourself.

However, the problem may well be a bug in Doconce. The Doconce
software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of "debugging" Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.


General Problems
----------------

Figure captions are incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If only the first part of a figure caption in the Doconce file is seen
in the target output format, the reason is usually that the caption
occupies multiple lines in the Doconce file. The figure caption must
be written as *one line*, at the same line as the FIGURE keyword.

Preprocessor directives do not work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the preprocessor instructions, in Preprocess or Mako, have
correct syntax. Also make sure that you do not mix Preprocess and Mako
instructions. Doconce will then only run Preprocess.

Problems with boldface and emphasize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two boldface or emphasize expressions after each other are not rendered
correctly. Merge them into one common expression.

Strange non-English characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the encoding of the .do.txt file with the Unix file command
or with::


        Unix> doconce guess_encoding myfile.do.txt

If the encoding is utf-8, convert to latin-1 using either of
the Unix commands::


        Unix> doconce change_encoding utf-8 LATIN1 myfile.do.txt
        Unix> iconv -f utf-8 -t LATIN1 myfile.do.txt --output newfile



Problems with Code or Tex Blocks
--------------------------------

Code or TeX block errors in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes reStructuredText (reST) reports an "Unexpected indentation"
at the beginning of a code block. If you see a !bc, which should
have been removed by doconce format, it is usually an error in the
Doconce source, or a problem with the rst/sphinx translator.  Check if
the line before the code block ends in one colon (not two!), a
question mark, an exclamation mark, a comma, a period, or just a
newline/space after text. If not, make sure that the ending is among
the mentioned. Then !bc will most likely be replaced and a double
colon at the preceding line will appear (which is the right way in
reST to indicate a verbatim block of text).

Strange errors around code or TeX blocks in reST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If idx commands for defining indices are placed inside paragraphs,
and especially right before a code block, the reST translator
(rst and sphinx formats) may get confused and produce strange
code blocks that cause errors when the reST text is transformed to
other formats. The remedy is to define items for the index outside
paragraphs.

Verbatim code blocks inside lists look ugly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the the section "Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code" above.  Start the::


        indenting the surrounding plain text of the list item correctly. If
        you cannot resolve the problem this way, get rid of the list and use
        paragraph headings instead. In fact, that is what is recommended:
        avoid verbatim code blocks inside lists (it makes life easier).
        
        LaTeX code blocks inside lists look ugly
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Same solution as for computer code blocks as described in the
        previous paragraph. Make sure the !bt and !et tags are in column 1
        and that the rest of the non-LaTeX surrounding text is correctly indented.
        Using paragraphs instead of list items is a good idea also here.
        
        
        Problems with reST Output
        -------------------------
        
        Lists do not appear in .rst files
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Check if you have a comment right above the list. That comment
        will include the list if the list is indentend. Remove the comment.
        
        Error message "Undefined substitution..." from reST
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This may happen if there is much inline math in the text. reST cannot
        understand inline LaTeX commands and interprets them as illegal code.
        Just ignore these error messages.
        
        Inconsistent headings in reST
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The rst2*.py and Sphinx converters abort if the headers of sections
        are not consistent, i.e., a subsection must come under a section,
        and a subsubsection must come under a subsection (you cannot have
        a subsubsection directly under a section). Search for ===,
        count the number of equality signs (or underscores if you use that)
        and make sure they decrease by two every time a lower level is encountered.
        
        Problems with LaTeX Output
        --------------------------
        
        The LaTeX file does not compile
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If the problem is undefined control sequence involving
        !bc 
        \code{...}

the cause is usually a verbatim inline text (in backquotes in the
Doconce file) spans more than one line. Make sure, in the Doconce source,
that all inline verbatim text appears on the same line.

Problems with gwiki Output
--------------------------

Strange nested lists in gwiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.
Use nonnested lists or edit the .gwiki file directly.

Lists in gwiki look ugly in the gwiki source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Google Code wiki format requires all text of a list item to
be on one line, Doconce simply concatenates lines in that format,
and because of the indentation in the original Doconce text, the gwiki
output looks somewhat ugly. The good thing is that this gwiki source
is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.

Debugging
---------

Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
_doconce_debugging.log, if the to doconce format after the filename
is debug. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section "Basic Parsing
Ideas" explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.



Basic Parsing Ideas
===================


The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in
the document are first copied into verbatim blocks.

All verbatim and TeX blocks are removed and stored elsewhere
to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.

The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression::


        (?P<indent> *(?P<listtype>[*o-] )? *)(?P<keyword>[^:]+?:)?(?P<text>.*)\s?


That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.

When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.

The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).

It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reStructuredText and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reStructuredText or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.


A Glimpse of How to Write a New Translator
------------------------------------------

This is the HTML-specific part of the
source code of the HTML translator::


        FILENAME_EXTENSION['html'] = '.html'  # output file extension
        BLANKLINE['html'] = '<p>\n'           # blank input line => new paragraph
        INLINE_TAGS_SUBST['html'] = {         # from inline tags to HTML tags
            # keep math as is:
            'math': None,  # indicates no substitution
            'emphasize':     r'\g<begin><em>\g<subst></em>\g<end>',
            'bold':          r'\g<begin><b>\g<subst></b>\g<end>',
            'verbatim':      r'\g<begin><tt>\g<subst></tt>\g<end>',
            'URL':           r'\g<begin><a href="\g<url>">\g<link></a>',
            'section':       r'<h1>\g<subst></h1>',
            'subsection':    r'<h3>\g<subst></h3>',
            'subsubsection': r'<h5>\g<subst></h5>',
            'paragraph':     r'<b>\g<subst></b>. ',
            'title':         r'<title>\g<subst></title>\n<center><h1>\g<subst></h1></center>',
            'date':          r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',
            'author':        r'<center><h3>\g<subst></h3></center>',
            }
        
        # how to replace code and latex blocks by html (<pre>) environment:
        def html_code(filestr):
            c = re.compile(r'^!bc(.*?)\n', re.MULTILINE)
            filestr = c.sub(r'<!-- BEGIN VERBATIM BLOCK \g<1>-->\n<pre>\n', filestr)
            filestr = re.sub(r'!ec\n',
                             r'</pre>\n<! -- END VERBATIM BLOCK -->\n', filestr)
            c = re.compile(r'^!bt\n', re.MULTILINE)
            filestr = c.sub(r'<pre>\n', filestr)
            filestr = re.sub(r'!et\n', r'</pre>\n', filestr)
            return filestr
        CODE['html'] = html_code
        
        # how to typeset lists and their items in html:
        LIST['html'] = {
            'itemize':
            {'begin': '\n<ul>\n', 'item': '<li>', 'end': '</ul>\n\n'},
            'enumerate':
            {'begin': '\n<ol>\n', 'item': '<li>', 'end': '</ol>\n\n'},
            'description':
            {'begin': '\n<dl>\n', 'item': '<dt>%s<dd>', 'end': '</dl>\n\n'},
            }
        
        # how to type set description lists for function arguments, return
        # values, and module/class variables:
        ARGLIST['html'] = {
            'parameter': '<b>argument</b>',
            'keyword': '<b>keyword argument</b>',
            'return': '<b>return value(s)</b>',
            'instance variable': '<b>instance variable</b>',
            'class variable': '<b>class variable</b>',
            'module variable': '<b>module variable</b>',
            }
        
        # document start:
        INTRO['html'] = """
        <html>
        <body bgcolor="white">
        """
        # document ending:
        OUTRO['html'] = """
        </body>
        </html>
        """



Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------

As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and *placed at the end of
the doc string*. Note that argument, keyword argument, return,
instance variable, class variable, and module variable are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted::


            - argument x: x value (float),
              which must be a positive number.
            - keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
              the iterations.
            - return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
            - instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
            - class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
            - module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
              (bool variable).


The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
and Sphinx just typeset the list as a list with keywords.

    module variable x: 
      x value (float),
      which must be a positive number.

    module variable tolerance: 
      tolerance (float) for stopping
      the iterations.

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.1pre quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > jsmath: include math, rendered in the browser by JSMath (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Making sphinx-rootdir
Welcome to the Sphinx 1.1pre quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Enter the root path for documentation.
> Root path for the documentation [.]: 
You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/N) [n]: 
Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]: 
The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: > Author name(s): 
Sphinx has the notion of a "version" and a "release" for the
software. Each version can have multiple releases. For example, for
Python the version is something like 2.5 or 3.0, while the release is
something like 2.5.1 or 3.0a1.  If you don't need this dual structure,
just set both to the same value.
> Project version: > Project release [1.0]: 
The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: * Please enter a file suffix, e.g. '.rst' or '.txt'.
> Source file suffix [.rst]: 
One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]: 
Sphinx can also add configuration for epub output:
> Do you want to use the epub builder (y/N) [n]: 
Please indicate if you want to use one of the following Sphinx extensions:
> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/N) [n]: > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/N) [n]: > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/N) [n]: > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/N) [n]: > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/N) [n]: > pngmath: include math, rendered as PNG images (y/N) [n]: > jsmath: include math, rendered in the browser by JSMath (y/N) [n]: > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/N) [n]: > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/N) [n]: 
A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
directly.
> Create Makefile? (Y/n) [y]: > Create Windows command file? (Y/n) [y]: 
Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file sphinx-rootdir/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
