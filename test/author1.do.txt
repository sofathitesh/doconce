# Externaldocument: testdoc

========= Generalized References =========
label{genrefs}

Sometimes a series of individual documents may be assembled to one
large document. The assembly impacts how references to sections
are written: when referring to a section in the same document, a label
can be used, while references to sections in other documents are
written differently, sometimes involving a link (URL) and a citation.
Especially if both the individual documents and the large assembly document
are to exist side by side, a flexible way of referencing is needed.
For this purpose, Doconce offers *generalized references* which allows
a reference to have two different formulations, one for internal
references and one for external references. Since LaTeX supports
references to labels in external documents via the `xr` package,
the generalized references in Doconce has a syntax that may utilize
the `xr` feature in LaTeX.

The syntax of generalized references reads
!bc
ref[internal][cite][external]
!ec
If all `ref{label}` references in the text `internal` are references
to labels in the present document, the above `ref` command is replaced
by the text `internal`. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is `latex` or `pdflatex` one assumes that the references in `internal`
are to external documents declared by a comment line `#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc` (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is `internal cite` and the
LaTeX package `xr` is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
If none of the two situations above applies, the `external`
text will be the output.

Here is a specific example on a generalized reference:
!bc
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in "Langtangen, 2013":
"http://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}][a "section": "demo_testdoc.html#___sec2" in
the document "A Document for Testing Doconce": "demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}], Doconce documents may include movies.
!ec
This is rendered to the following text:
As explained in
ref[Section ref{subsec:ex}][in "Langtangen, 2013":
"http://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/test/demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}][a "section": "demo_testdoc.html#___sec2" in
the document "A Document for Testing Doconce": "demo_testdoc.html"
cite{testdoc:12}], Doconce documents may include movies.

And here is another example with internal references only:
!bc
Generalized references are described in ref[Section ref{genrefs}][][
the document *author1*].
!ec
The text is rendered to "Generalized references are described in
ref[Section ref{genrefs}][][
the document *author1*]."

# We are testing chapter too to see if latex output then has
# book style rather than article style.

Inline math, $a=b$, is the only math in this document.
