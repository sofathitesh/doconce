# Purpose: see if doconce detects dangerous lines for mako,
# starting with a %, and here it is crucial since the
# running text does need mako

% if FORMAT == "html":

# This if test will never be treated by mako: for
# mako_test3b.html mako is not run because problems
# are detected, and for mako_test3.html we use the
# --no-mako command-line option
