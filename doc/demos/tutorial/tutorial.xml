start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage

looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
(reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
emails). From reST you can (via <literal>rst2*</literal> programs) go to XML, HTML,
LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via <literal>unoconv</literal>) to
RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
The slogan is: &quot;Write once, include anywhere&quot;.</paragraph></list_item></enumerated_list></block_quote><paragraph>Here are some Doconce features:</paragraph><block_quote><bullet_list bullet="*"><list_item><paragraph>Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
LaTeX and HTML.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce can be converted to plain <emphasis>untagged</emphasis> text,
often desirable for computer programs and email.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
directly from the source code files via regular expressions
for the start and end lines.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
with big LaTeX projects (books).</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
construction for generating parts of the text.</paragraph></list_item></bullet_list></block_quote><paragraph>Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:</paragraph><block_quote><bullet_list bullet="*"><list_item><paragraph>Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.</paragraph></list_item></bullet_list></block_quote><paragraph>History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.</paragraph><paragraph>Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.</paragraph></section><section ids="what-does-doconce-look-like" names="what\ does\ doconce\ look\ like?"><title>What Does Doconce Look Like?</title><paragraph>Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible

label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in &quot;hpl&quot;:&quot;http://folk.uio.no/hpl&quot;.
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in &quot;URL&quot;: &quot;tutorial.do.txt&quot;.

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
&quot;label&quot; command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Section ref{my:first:sec}.

Doconce also allows inline comments of the form [name: comment] (with
a space after `name:`), e.g., such as [hpl: here I will make some
remarks to the text]. Inline comments can be removed from the output
by a command-line argument (see Section ref{doconce2formats} for an
example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |---r-------r-----------r--------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |

allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like v = sin(x) is
typeset as:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$</literal_block><paragraph>The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.</paragraph><paragraph>Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
<literal>!bt</literal> and <literal>!et</literal> (begin tex / end tex) instructions.
The result looks like this:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">\begin{align}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &amp;= \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &amp;= \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{align}</literal_block><paragraph>Of course, such blocks only looks nice in formats with support
for LaTeX mathematics, and here the align environment in particular
(this includes <literal>latex</literal>, <literal>pdflatex</literal>, <literal>html</literal>, and <literal>sphinx</literal>). The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in simpler formats, but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax.</paragraph><paragraph>You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
<literal>!bc</literal> and <literal>!ec</literal> instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)</literal_block><paragraph>A code block must come after some plain sentence (at least for successful
output to <literal>sphinx</literal>, <literal>rst</literal>, and ASCII-close formats),
not directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.</paragraph><paragraph>It is possible to add a specification of an
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., <literal>!bc xxx</literal>
where <literal>xxx</literal> is an identifier like <literal>pycod</literal> for code snippet in Python,
<literal>sys</literal> for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in <literal>ptex2tex</literal> and defined in a
configuration file <literal>.ptext2tex.cfg</literal>, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve"># sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console</literal_block><paragraph>By default, <literal>pro</literal> and <literal>cod</literal> are <literal>python</literal>, <literal>sys</literal> is <literal>console</literal>,

in <literal>f</literal> (Fortran), <literal>c</literal> (C), <literal>cpp</literal> (C++), <literal>pl</literal> (Perl), <literal>m</literal> (Matlab),
<literal>sh</literal> (Unix shells), <literal>cy</literal> (Cython), and <literal>py</literal> (Python).</paragraph><comment xml:space="preserve">(Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">first one is used.)</comment><paragraph>One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset
with <literal>!bc pro</literal>, while a part of a file is copied into a <literal>!bc cod</literal>
environment. What <literal>pro</literal> and <literal>cod</literal> mean is then defined through
a <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal> file for LaTeX and a <literal>sphinx code-blocks</literal>
comment for Sphinx.</paragraph><paragraph>Another document can be included by writing <literal>#include &quot;mynote.do.txt&quot;</literal>
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension <literal>do.txt</literal>. The <literal>do</literal> part stands for doconce, while the
trailing <literal>.txt</literal> denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.</paragraph><target refid="newcommands"/></section><section ids="macros-newcommands-cross-references-index-and-bibliography newcommands" names="macros\ (newcommands),\ cross-references,\ index,\ and\ bibliography newcommands"><title>Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography</title><paragraph>Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style <emphasis>newcommand</emphasis>
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
<literal>newcommand_replace.tex</literal> are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names <literal>newcommands.tex</literal> and
<literal>newcommands_keep.tex</literal> are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
<literal>!bt</literal> and <literal>!et</literal> in <literal>newcommands_keep.tex</literal> to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
<literal>newcommands_replace.tex</literal> and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the <literal>newcommands*.tex</literal> files <emphasis>must</emphasis> appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).</paragraph><paragraph>Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the <literal>doc/manual/manual.do.txt</literal> file (see the
<reference name="demo page" refuri="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html">demo page</reference><target ids="demo-page" names="demo\ page" refuri="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/doc/demos/manual/index.html"/>

Terminal&gt; doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako</literal_block><paragraph>The variable <literal>FORMAT</literal> is always defined as the current format when
running <literal>preprocess</literal>. That is, in the last example, <literal>FORMAT</literal> is
defined as <literal>latex</literal>. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like <literal>#if FORMAT == &quot;latex&quot;</literal>.</paragraph><paragraph>The command-line arguments <literal>--no-preprocess</literal> and <literal>--no-mako</literal> turn off

is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument <literal>--no-pygments-html</literal>
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain (<literal>pre</literal>) HTML tags. The option <literal>--pygments-html-linenos</literal> turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.</paragraph><paragraph>The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three &quot;slots&quot;: <literal>%(title)s</literal> for a title,
<literal>%(date)s</literal> for a date, and <literal>%(main)s</literal> for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
<literal>DATE:</literal> line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert <literal>%(title)s</literal> and
<literal>%(date)s</literal> at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by <literal>%(main)s</literal>. Here is an example:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html</literal_block></section><section ids="pandoc-and-markdown" names="pandoc\ and\ markdown"><title>Pandoc and Markdown</title><paragraph>Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>The name of the output file is <literal>mydoc.mkd</literal>.

Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the <literal>--toc</literal> option generates a table of contents.
See the <reference name="Pandoc documentation" refuri="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc documentation</reference><target ids="pandoc-documentation" names="pandoc\ documentation" refuri="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html"/>
for the many features of the <literal>pandoc</literal> program.</paragraph><paragraph>Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
<literal>doconce format pandoc</literal> and then translating using <literal>pandoc</literal>, or
<literal>doconce format latex</literal>, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using <literal>pandoc</literal>.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal&gt; pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex</literal_block><paragraph>When we go through <literal>pandoc</literal>, only single equations or <literal>align*</literal>
environments are well understood.</paragraph><paragraph>Quite some <literal>doconce replace</literal> and <literal>doconce subst</literal> edits might be needed
on the <literal>.mkd</literal> or <literal>.tex</literal> files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal&gt; pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd</literal_block><paragraph>The <literal>-s</literal> option adds a proper header and footer to the <literal>mydoc.html</literal> file.

If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.</paragraph><paragraph>An option <literal>--latex-printed</literal> makes some adjustments for documents
aimed at being printed. For example, links to web resources are
associated with a footnote listing the complete web address (URL).</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 2.</emphasis> Run <literal>ptex2tex</literal> (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; ptex2tex mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>In case you do not have <literal>ptex2tex</literal>, you may run a (very) simplified version:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>Note that Doconce generates a <literal>.p.tex</literal> file with some preprocessor macros

different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any <literal>!bc</literal> command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal>
file, e.g., <literal>!bc sys</literal> for a terminal session, where <literal>sys</literal> is set to
a certain environment in <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal> (e.g., <literal>CodeTerminal</literal>).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.</paragraph><paragraph>Also the <literal>doconce ptex2tex</literal> command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the <literal>.p.tex</literal> file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          &quot;sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}&quot; \

above, which implies <literal>\begin{minted}{fortran}</literal> and <literal>\end{minted}</literal> as
begin and end for blocks inside <literal>!bc fpro</literal> and <literal>!ec</literal>).  Specifying
<literal>envir=ans:nt</literal> means that all other environments are typeset with the
<literal>anslistings.sty</literal> package, e.g., <literal>!bc cppcod</literal> will then result in
<literal>\begin{c++}</literal>. If no environments like <literal>sys</literal>, <literal>fpro</literal>, or the common
<literal>envir</literal> are defined on the command line, the plain <literal>\begin{verbatim}</literal>
and <literal>\end{verbatim}</literal> used.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 2b (optional).</emphasis> Edit the <literal>mydoc.tex</literal> file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute <literal>section</literal> by <literal>section*</literal> to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the <literal>doconce replace</literal> and <literal>doconce subst</literal>
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal&gt; doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g&lt;1&gt; \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g&lt;2&gt;' mydoc.tex</literal_block><paragraph>A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 3.</emphasis> Compile <literal>mydoc.tex</literal>

We have automated
most of the steps through the <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> command:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir author=&quot;authors' names&quot; \
          title=&quot;some title&quot; version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...</literal_block><paragraph>The keywords <literal>author</literal>, <literal>title</literal>, and <literal>version</literal> are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, <literal>version</literal> is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files <literal>file1</literal>,
<literal>file2</literal>, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files <literal>file1</literal>, <literal>file2</literal>, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of <literal>dirname</literal> is <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>. The <literal>theme</literal>
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is <literal>'default'</literal>).</paragraph><paragraph>With a single-file document in <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal> one often just runs:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>and then an appropriate Sphinx directory <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal> is made with
relevant files.</paragraph><paragraph>The <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> command generates a script
<literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal> for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run <literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal> or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.</paragraph><paragraph>The <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> script copies directories named <literal>figs</literal> or
<literal>figures</literal> over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, <literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal> must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not <literal>http:</literal> or <literal>file:</literal> URLs), must be
placed in the <literal>_static</literal> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility <literal>doconce sphinxfix_localURLs</literal> is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say <literal>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</literal> it
replaces the link by <literal>_static/myfile.txt</literal> and copies
<literal>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</literal> to a local <literal>_static</literal> directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in <literal>_static</literal> or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all <literal>_static/*</literal> files to the
<literal>_static</literal> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a <literal>_static</literal> or <literal>_static-name</literal> directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.</paragraph><paragraph>Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the <literal>conf.py</literal>
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
<literal>make-themes.sh</literal> can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes <literal>fenics</literal> and <literal>pyramid</literal>, one writes:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid</literal_block><paragraph>The resulting directories with HTML documents are <literal>_build/html_fenics</literal>
and <literal>_build/html_pyramid</literal>, respectively. Without arguments,
<literal>make-themes.sh</literal> makes all available themes (!).</paragraph><paragraph>If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal>.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 1.</emphasis> Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format sphinx mydoc</literal_block><paragraph><emphasis>Step 2.</emphasis> Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive <literal>sphinx-quickstart</literal>

may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> generator makes an extended <literal>conv.py</literal>
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 3.</emphasis> Copy the <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> file to the Sphinx root directory:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir</literal_block><paragraph>If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> in the <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>
directory. Either edit <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>.
Links to local files in <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> must be modified to links to
files in the <literal>_static</literal> directory, see comment above.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 4.</emphasis> Edit the generated <literal>index.rst</literal> file so that <literal>mydoc.rst</literal>
is included, i.e., add <literal>mydoc</literal> to the <literal>toctree</literal> section so that it becomes:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>(The spaces before <literal>mydoc</literal> are important!)</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 5.</emphasis> Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">make clean   # remove old versions
make html</literal_block><paragraph>Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with <literal>index.html</literal> files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 6.</emphasis> View the result:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; firefox _build/html/index.html</literal_block><paragraph>Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows <literal>!bc</literal>: <literal>cod</literal> gives Python
(<literal>code-block:: python</literal> in Sphinx syntax) and <literal>cppcod</literal> gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.</paragraph></section><section ids="wiki-formats" names="wiki\ formats"><title>Wiki Formats</title><paragraph>There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
<reference name="Googlecode wiki" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax">Googlecode wiki</reference><target ids="googlecode-wiki" names="googlecode\ wiki" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax"/>, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
<literal>gwiki</literal>, <literal>mwiki</literal>, and <literal>cwiki</literal>, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal&gt; doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal&gt; doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt</literal_block><paragraph>The Googlecode wiki document, <literal>mydoc.gwiki</literal>, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.</paragraph><paragraph>When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the <literal>.gwiki</literal> file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).</paragraph><paragraph>From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of <reference name="mwlib" refuri="http://pediapress.com/code/">mwlib</reference><target ids="mwlib" names="mwlib" refuri="http://pediapress.com/code/"/>. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write <reference name="Wikibooks" refuri="http://en.wikibooks.org">Wikibooks</reference><target ids="wikibooks" names="wikibooks" refuri="http://en.wikibooks.org"/>
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.</paragraph></section><section ids="tweaking-the-doconce-output" names="tweaking\ the\ doconce\ output"><title>Tweaking the Doconce Output</title><paragraph>Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
<literal>.rst</literal> file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if <literal>.eps</literal> or <literal>.png</literal> is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The <literal>make.sh</literal> files in <literal>docs/manual</literal> and <literal>docs/tutorial</literal>
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.</paragraph></section><section ids="demos" names="demos"><title>Demos</title><paragraph>The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt</literal_block><paragraph>The file <literal>make.sh</literal> in the <literal>tutorial</literal> directory of the

starting point.  Running <literal>make.sh</literal> and studying the various generated

program.</paragraph><paragraph>The <emphasis>minted</emphasis> LaTeX style is offered by <literal>ptex2tex</literal> and <literal>doconce ptext2tex</literal>
is popular among many
users. This style requires the package <reference name="Pygments" refuri="http://pygments.org">Pygments</reference><target ids="pygments" names="pygments" refuri="http://pygments.org"/>
to be installed:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install</literal_block><paragraph>If you use the minted style together with <literal>ptex2tex</literal>, you have to
enable it by the <literal>-DMINTED</literal> command-line argument to <literal>ptex2tex</literal>.  All
use of the minted style requires the <literal>-shell-escape</literal> command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., <literal>latex -shell-escape</literal> or <literal>pdflatex
-shell-escape</literal>.</paragraph><comment xml:space="preserve">Say something about anslistings.sty</comment></section><section ids="restructuredtext-rest-output" names="restructuredtext\ (rest)\ output"><title>reStructuredText (reST) Output</title><paragraph>The <literal>rst</literal> output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
