looks like ordinary ASCII text, much like what you would use in an
email, but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
including HTML, Sphinx, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Markdown,
MediaWiki, Google wiki, Creole wiki, blogger.com, wordpress.com,
Epytext, and also plain (untagged) text for email.
From reST or Markdown you can go to XML, OpenOffice, MS
Word, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, DocBook, GNU Texinfo, and more.</paragraph><paragraph>Doconce supports a working strategy of never duplicating information.
Text is written in a single place and then transformed to a number of
different destinations of diverse type: scientific reports, software
manuals, books, thesis, software source code, wikis, blogs, emails,
etc.  The slogan is: &quot;Write once, include anywhere&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>Here are some Doconce features:</paragraph><block_quote><bullet_list bullet="*"><list_item><paragraph>Doconce addresses small and large documents containing
<emphasis>text with much computer source code and
LaTeX mathematics</emphasis>, where the output is desired in different formats
such as LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, Sphinx, HTML,
MediaWiki, blogger.com, and wordpress.com.
A piece of Doconce text can enter (e.g.) a classical
science book, an ebook, a web document, and a blog.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce targets in particular large book projects where many different
pieces of text and software can be assembled and published in different
formats for different devices.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce enables authors who write for many times of media
(blogs, wikis, LaTeX manuscripts, Sphinx, HTML) to use a common
source language such that lots of different pieces can easily be
brought together later to form a coherent (big) document.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce has good support for copying computer code
directly from the source code files via regular expressions
for the start and end lines.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce first runs two preprocessors (Preprocess and Mako), which
allow programming constructs (includes, if-tests, function calls)
as part of the text. This feature makes it easy to write <emphasis>one text</emphasis>
with different flavors: long vs short text, Python vs Matlab code
examples, experimental vs mature content.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce can be converted to plain <emphasis>untagged</emphasis> text,
often desirable for email and computer code documentation.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
Markdown, but less than reST, and very much less than
LaTeX and HTML.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Compared to the related tools Sphinx and Markdown, Doconce
allows more types of equations (especially systems of
equations with references), has more flexible
inclusion of source code, integrates preprocessors, has
special support for exercises, and produces
cleaner LaTeX and HTML output.</paragraph></list_item></bullet_list></block_quote><paragraph><emphasis>History.</emphasis> Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Disclaimer.</emphasis> Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.</paragraph></section><section ids="installation-of-doconce-and-its-dependencies" names="installation\ of\ doconce\ and\ its\ dependencies"><title>Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies</title><section ids="doconce" names="doconce"><title>Doconce</title><paragraph>Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at <reference name="http://code.google.com/p/doconce" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/doconce">http://code.google.com/p/doconce</reference><target ids="http-code-google-com-p-doconce" names="http://code.google.com/p/doconce" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/doconce"/>.  Its installation from the
Mercurial (<literal>hg</literal>) source follows the standard procedure:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve"># Doconce
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/doconce/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..</literal_block><paragraph>Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install</literal_block><paragraph>Debian GNU/Linux users can also run:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">sudo apt-get install doconce</literal_block><paragraph>This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa

tarball, pack it out, go to the directory and run
the usual <literal>sudo python setup.py install</literal>.</paragraph></section><section ids="image-file-handling" names="image\ file\ handling"><title>Image file handling</title><paragraph>Different output formats require different formats of image files.
For example, PostScript or Encapuslated PostScript is required for <literal>latex</literal>
output, while HTML needs JPEG, GIF, or PNG formats.
Doconce calls up programs from the ImageMagick suite for converting
image files to a proper format if needed. The <reference name="ImageMagick suite" refuri="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick suite</reference><target ids="imagemagick-suite" names="imagemagick\ suite" refuri="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php"/> can be installed on all major platforms.
On Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems one can simply write:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">sudo apt-get install imagemagick</literal_block><paragraph>The convenience program <literal>doconce combine_images</literal>, for combining several
images into one, will use <literal>montage</literal> and <literal>convert</literal> from ImageMagick and
the <literal>pdftk</literal>, <literal>pdfnup</literal>, and <literal>pdfcrop</literal> programs from the <literal>texlive-extra-utils</literal>

a script, <literal>cp2texmf.sh</literal>:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..</literal_block><paragraph>This script copies some special stylefiles that
that <literal>ptex2tex</literal> potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra</literal_block><paragraph>on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the <literal>~/texmf/tex/latex/misc</literal> directory).</paragraph><paragraph>Note that the <literal>doconce ptex2tex</literal> command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the <literal>ptex2tex</literal>
program.</paragraph><paragraph>The <emphasis>minted</emphasis> LaTeX style is offered by <literal>ptex2tex</literal> and <literal>doconce ptext2tex</literal>
and popular among many
users. This style requires the package <reference name="Pygments" refuri="http://pygments.org">Pygments</reference><target ids="pygments" names="pygments" refuri="http://pygments.org"/>
to be installed. On Debian Linux:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">sudo apt-get install python-pygments</literal_block><paragraph>Alternatively, the package can be installed manually:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install</literal_block><paragraph>If you use the minted style together with <literal>ptex2tex</literal>, you have to
enable it by the <literal>-DMINTED</literal> command-line argument to <literal>ptex2tex</literal>.
This is not necessary if you run the alternative <literal>doconce ptex2tex</literal> program.</paragraph><paragraph>All
use of the minted style requires the <literal>-shell-escape</literal> command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., <literal>latex -shell-escape</literal> or <literal>pdflatex
-shell-escape</literal>.</paragraph><comment xml:space="preserve">Say something about anslistings.sty</comment></section><section ids="restructuredtext-rest-output" names="restructuredtext\ (rest)\ output"><title>reStructuredText (reST) Output</title><paragraph>The <literal>rst</literal> output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,

defined as <literal>latex</literal>. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like <literal>#if FORMAT == &quot;latex&quot;</literal>

and comments by different authors should be removed.</paragraph></section><section ids="html" names="html"><title>HTML</title><paragraph>Making an HTML version of a Doconce file <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal>
is performed by:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format html mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>The resulting file <literal>mydoc.html</literal> can be loaded into any web browser for viewing.</paragraph><paragraph>The HTML style can be defined either in the header of the HTML file or
in an external CSS file. The latter is enabled by the command-line
argument <literal>--css=filename</literal>. There is a default style with blue headings,
and a style with the <reference name="solarized" refuri="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">solarized</reference><target ids="solarized" names="solarized" refuri="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized"/>
color palette, specified by the <literal>--html-solarized</literal> command line
argument. If there is no file with name <literal>filename</literal> in the <literal>--css=filename</literal>
specification, the blue or solarized styles are written to <literal>filename</literal>
and linked from the HTML document. You can provide your own style sheet
either by replacing the content inside the <literal>style</literal> tags or by
specifying a CSS file through the <literal>--css=filename</literal> option.</paragraph><paragraph>If the Pygments package (including the <literal>pygmentize</literal> program)
is installed, code blocks are typeset with
aid of this package. The command-line argument <literal>--no-pygments-html</literal>
turns off the use of Pygments and makes code blocks appear with
plain (<literal>pre</literal>) HTML tags. The option <literal>--pygments-html-linenos</literal> turns
on line numbers in Pygments-formatted code blocks.</paragraph><paragraph>The HTML file can be embedded in a template if the Doconce document
does not have a title (because then there will be
no header and footer in the HTML file). The template file must contain
valid HTML code and can have three &quot;slots&quot;: <literal>%(title)s</literal> for a title,
<literal>%(date)s</literal> for a date, and <literal>%(main)s</literal> for the main body of text, i.e., the
Doconce document translated to HTML. The title becomes the first
heading in the Doconce document, and the date is extracted from the
<literal>DATE:</literal> line, if present. With the template feature one can easily embed
the text in the look and feel of a website. The template can be extracted
from the source code of a page at the site; just insert <literal>%(title)s</literal> and
<literal>%(date)s</literal> at appropriate places and replace the main bod of text
by <literal>%(main)s</literal>. Here is an example:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format html mydoc --html-template=mytemplate.html</literal_block></section><section ids="blogs" names="blogs"><title>Blogs</title><paragraph>Doconce can be used for writing blogs provided the blog site accepts
raw HTML code. Google's Blogger service (<literal>blogger.com</literal> or
<literal>blogname.blogspot.com</literal>)
is particularly well suited since it also allows extensive LaTeX mathematics via
MathJax.
Write the blog text as a Doconce document without any title, author, and
date. Then generate HTML as described above. Copy the text and paste it
into the text area in the blog, making sure the input format is HTML.
On Google's Blogger service you can use Doconce to generate blogs with
LaTeX mathematics and pretty (pygmentized) blocks of computer code.

in a way that is acceptable to WordPress.

on blogging with mathematics and code on WordPress.</paragraph></section><section ids="pandoc-and-markdown" names="pandoc\ and\ markdown"><title>Pandoc and Markdown</title><paragraph>Output in Pandoc's extended Markdown format results from:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>The name of the output file is <literal>mydoc.mkd</literal>.

Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it,
while the <literal>--toc</literal> option generates a table of contents.
See the <reference name="Pandoc documentation" refuri="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc documentation</reference><target ids="pandoc-documentation" names="pandoc\ documentation" refuri="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html"/>
for the many features of the <literal>pandoc</literal> program.</paragraph><paragraph>Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
<literal>doconce format pandoc</literal> and then translating using <literal>pandoc</literal>, or
<literal>doconce format latex</literal>, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using <literal>pandoc</literal>.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce replace '\Verb!' '\verb!' mydoc.tex
Terminal&gt; pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex</literal_block><paragraph>When we go through <literal>pandoc</literal>, only single equations or <literal>align*</literal>
environments are well understood.</paragraph><paragraph>Note that Doconce applies the <literal>Verb</literal> macro from the <literal>fancyvrb</literal> package
while <literal>pandoc</literal> only supports the standard <literal>verb</literal> construction for
inline verbatim text.  Moreover, quite some additional <literal>doconce
replace</literal> and <literal>doconce subst</literal> edits might be needed on the <literal>.mkd</literal> or
<literal>.tex</literal> files to successfully have mathematics that is well translated
to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using Pandoc, it can
be advantageous to go via LaTeX.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal&gt; pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd</literal_block><paragraph>The <literal>-s</literal> option adds a proper header and footer to the <literal>mydoc.html</literal> file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.</paragraph></section><section ids="latex" names="latex"><title>LaTeX</title><paragraph>Making a LaTeX file <literal>mydoc.tex</literal> from <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal> is done in two steps:

If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document

aimed at being printed. For example, links to web resources are
associated with a footnote listing the complete web address (URL).</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 2.</emphasis> Run <literal>ptex2tex</literal> (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; ptex2tex mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>In case you do not have <literal>ptex2tex</literal>, you may run a (very) simplified version:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>Note that Doconce generates a <literal>.p.tex</literal> file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative</literal_block><paragraph>The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having

your own preamble by adding the command-line option <literal>--latex-preamble=myfile</literal>.
In case <literal>myfile</literal> contains a documentclass definition, Doconce assumes
that the file contains the <emphasis>complete</emphasis> preamble you want (not that all
the packages listed in the default preamble are required and must be
present in <literal>myfile</literal>). Otherwise, <literal>myfile</literal> is assumed to contain
<emphasis>additional</emphasis> LaTeX code to be added to the Doconce default preamble.</paragraph><paragraph>The <literal>ptex2tex</literal> tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any <literal>!bc</literal> command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal>
file, e.g., <literal>!bc sys</literal> for a terminal session, where <literal>sys</literal> is set to
a certain environment in <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal> (e.g., <literal>CodeTerminal</literal>).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.</paragraph><paragraph>Also the <literal>doconce ptex2tex</literal> command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the <literal>.p.tex</literal> file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          &quot;sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}&quot; \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt</literal_block><paragraph>Note that <literal>@</literal> must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as <literal>minted</literal>
above, which implies <literal>\begin{minted}{fortran}</literal> and <literal>\end{minted}</literal> as
begin and end for blocks inside <literal>!bc fpro</literal> and <literal>!ec</literal>).  Specifying
<literal>envir=ans:nt</literal> means that all other environments are typeset with the
<literal>anslistings.sty</literal> package, e.g., <literal>!bc cppcod</literal> will then result in
<literal>\begin{c++}</literal>. If no environments like <literal>sys</literal>, <literal>fpro</literal>, or the common
<literal>envir</literal> are defined on the command line, the plain <literal>\begin{verbatim}</literal>
and <literal>\end{verbatim}</literal> used.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 2b (optional).</emphasis> Edit the <literal>mydoc.tex</literal> file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute <literal>section</literal> by <literal>section*</literal> to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the <literal>doconce replace</literal> and <literal>doconce subst</literal>
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal&gt; doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g&lt;1&gt; \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g&lt;2&gt;' mydoc.tex</literal_block><paragraph>A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 3.</emphasis> Compile <literal>mydoc.tex</literal>

We have automated
most of the steps through the <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> command:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir author=&quot;authors' names&quot; \
          title=&quot;some title&quot; version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...</literal_block><paragraph>The keywords <literal>author</literal>, <literal>title</literal>, and <literal>version</literal> are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, <literal>version</literal> is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files <literal>file1</literal>,
<literal>file2</literal>, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files <literal>file1</literal>, <literal>file2</literal>, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of <literal>dirname</literal> is <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>. The <literal>theme</literal>
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is <literal>'default'</literal>).</paragraph><paragraph>With a single-file document in <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal> one often just runs:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>and then an appropriate Sphinx directory <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal> is made with
relevant files.</paragraph><paragraph>The <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> command generates a script
<literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal> for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run <literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal> or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.</paragraph><paragraph>The <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> script copies directories named <literal>figs</literal> or
<literal>figures</literal> over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, <literal>automake_sphinx.py</literal> must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not <literal>http:</literal> or <literal>file:</literal> URLs), must be
placed in the <literal>_static</literal> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility <literal>doconce sphinxfix_localURLs</literal> is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say <literal>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</literal> it
replaces the link by <literal>_static/myfile.txt</literal> and copies
<literal>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</literal> to a local <literal>_static</literal> directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in <literal>_static</literal> or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all <literal>_static/*</literal> files to the
<literal>_static</literal> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a <literal>_static</literal> or <literal>_static-name</literal> directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.</paragraph><paragraph>Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the <literal>conf.py</literal>
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
<literal>make-themes.sh</literal> can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes <literal>fenics</literal> and <literal>pyramid</literal>, one writes:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid</literal_block><paragraph>The resulting directories with HTML documents are <literal>_build/html_fenics</literal>
and <literal>_build/html_pyramid</literal>, respectively. Without arguments,
<literal>make-themes.sh</literal> makes all available themes (!).</paragraph><paragraph>If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal>.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 1.</emphasis> Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format sphinx mydoc</literal_block><paragraph><emphasis>Step 2.</emphasis> Create a Sphinx root directory

file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 3.</emphasis> Copy the <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> file to the Sphinx root directory:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir</literal_block><paragraph>If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> in the <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>

or simply copy your figure directories to <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>.
Links to local files in <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> must be modified to links to
files in the <literal>_static</literal> directory, see comment above.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 4.</emphasis> Edit the generated <literal>index.rst</literal> file so that <literal>mydoc.rst</literal>

make html</literal_block><paragraph>Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with <literal>index.html</literal> files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,

These formats are called
<literal>gwiki</literal>, <literal>mwiki</literal>, and <literal>cwiki</literal>, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt

standard LaTeX book, a Sphinx web document, or a collection of HTML files.</paragraph><paragraph>The Googlecode wiki document, <literal>mydoc.gwiki</literal>, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.</paragraph><paragraph>When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the <literal>.gwiki</literal> file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).</paragraph></section><section ids="tweaking-the-doconce-output" names="tweaking\ the\ doconce\ output"><title>Tweaking the Doconce Output</title><paragraph>Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
<literal>.rst</literal> file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if <literal>.eps</literal> or <literal>.png</literal> is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final

very simple formatting usually avoids such problems).</paragraph></note></section><section ids="links-to-web-addresses" names="links\ to\ web\ addresses"><title>Links to Web Addresses</title><paragraph>Web addresses with links are typeset as:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">some URL like &quot;Search Google&quot;: &quot;http://google.com&quot;.</literal_block><paragraph>which appears as some URL like <reference name="Search Google" refuri="http://google.com">Search Google</reference><target ids="search-google" names="search\ google" refuri="http://google.com"/>.

will unless the <literal>.tex</literal> file has a full URL specified through
a <literal>\hyperbaseurl</literal> command and the linked files are located correctly
relative to this URL. Otherwise full URL must be used in links.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>In the <literal>sphinx</literal> format, links to local files do not work unless the
files reside in a <literal>_static</literal> directory (a warning is issued about this).</paragraph></list_item></bullet_list></block_quote><paragraph>As a consequence, we strongly recommend that one copies the relevant
files to a <literal>_static</literal> or <literal>_static-name</literal> directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (<literal>name</literal> is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL. If Doconce is used
for HTML output only, then plain links to local files work fine.</paragraph><paragraph>If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running
<literal>pygmentize</literal>, e.g.:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; pygmentize -l bash -f html -O full,style=emacs \
          -o _static/make.sh.html subdir/make.sh</literal_block><paragraph>Then you can link to <literal>_static/make.sh.html</literal> instead of
<literal>subdir/make.sh</literal>. Here is an example where the reader
has the file available as <literal>src/myprog.py</literal> in her
software and the document links to <literal>_static/myprog.py</literal>:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">See the code URL:&quot;src/myprog.py&quot; (&quot;view: &quot;_static/myprog.py.html&quot;).</literal_block><paragraph>Links to files with other extensions are typeset with
<emphasis>the filename as link text</emphasis>. The syntax consists of
the keyword URL, followed by a colon, and then the filename enclosed
in double quotes:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">URL: &quot;manual.html&quot;</literal_block><paragraph>resulting in the link <reference name="manual.html" refuri="manual.html">manual.html</reference><target ids="manual-html" names="manual.html" refuri="manual.html"/>.</paragraph><comment xml:space="preserve">This is now automatically carried out by the autogenerated</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">script for sphinx:</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">For such local links to</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">work with the ``sphinx`` format, the ``.rst`` file needs a fix, carried</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">out by</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">!bc sys</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">doconce sphinxfix_localURLs mydoc.rst</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">!ec</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">(The files, such as ``manual.html``, are then copied to a subdirectory</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">``_static``, which must be manually copied to the Sphinx directory's</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">``_static`` directory - links in the ``.rst`` files are automatically</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">adjusted.)</comment></section><section ids="inline-comments" names="inline\ comments"><title>Inline Comments</title><paragraph>Doconce also supports inline comments in the text:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">[name: comment]</literal_block><paragraph>where <literal>name</literal> is the name of the author of the command, and <literal>comment</literal> is a
plain text text. Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.
The name and comment are visible in the output unless <literal>doconce format</literal>
is run with a command-line argument <literal>--skip_inline_comments</literal>
(see the section <reference name="From Doconce to Other Formats" refid="from-doconce-to-other-formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</reference> for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the <literal>.do.txt</literal> file
(see the section <reference name="From Doconce to Other Formats" refid="from-doconce-to-other-formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</reference>).</paragraph></section><section ids="inline-mathematics" names="inline\ mathematics"><title>Inline Mathematics</title><paragraph>Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.</literal_block><paragraph>That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (<literal>latex</literal>, <literal>pdflatex</literal>, <literal>html</literal>,
<literal>sphinx</literal>, <literal>mwiki</literal>), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as &quot;Here is an example
on a linear system Ax=b, where A
is an nxn matrix, and x and b
are vectors of length n.&quot;</paragraph></section></section><section ids="comments" names="comments"><title>Comments</title><paragraph>Comments intended to be (sometimes) visible in the output document and
read by readers are known as <emphasis>inline comments</emphasis> in Doconce and
described in the section <reference name="Inline Tagging" refid="id2">Inline Tagging</reference>.</paragraph><paragraph>Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash <literal>#</literal>:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">#
# Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
# These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
#</literal_block><paragraph>Such comment lines may have some side effects in the <literal>rst</literal> and <literal>sphinx</literal>
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.</paragraph><paragraph>The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out <emphasis>before</emphasis>
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash <literal>##</literal> and lines enclosed by
the <literal>&lt;%doc&gt;</literal> (beginning) and <literal>&lt;%doc/&gt;</literal> (closing) tags.</paragraph><paragraph>If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want the
comments to be in the source code of the output document.</paragraph><paragraph>To comment out or remove large sections, consider using the Preprocess
preprocessor and an if-else block with a variable that is undefined
(typically something like a test <literal># #ifdef EXTRA</literal> in Preprocess).</paragraph></section><section ids="cross-referencing" names="cross-referencing"><title>Cross-Referencing</title><paragraph>References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.</literal_block><paragraph>This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
<literal>rst</literal> and <literal>sphinx</literal> formats, the end effect is the same, but
the &quot;label&quot; and &quot;ref&quot; commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by <literal>doconce format</literal>. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX &quot;label&quot; and &quot;ref&quot; are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.</paragraph><paragraph>It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure <reference name="fig:viz" refid="fig-viz">fig:viz</reference>
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections <reference name="LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text" refid="latex-blocks-of-mathematical-text">LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text</reference> and <reference name="Macros (Newcommands)" refid="macros-newcommands">Macros (Newcommands)</reference> are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equations (myeq1)-(myeq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.</paragraph><paragraph>Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section <reference name="Inline Tagging" refid="id2">Inline Tagging</reference>.</paragraph><target refid="manual-genrefs"/></section><section ids="generalized-cross-referencing manual-genrefs" names="generalized\ cross-referencing manual:genrefs"><title>Generalized Cross-Referencing</title><paragraph>Sometimes a series of individual documents may be assembled to one
large document. The assembly impacts how references to sections
are written: when referring to a section in the same document, a label
can be used, while references to sections in other documents are
written differently, sometimes involving a link (URL) and a citation.
Especially if both the individual documents and the large assembly document
are to exist side by side, a flexible way of referencing is needed.
For this purpose, Doconce offers <emphasis>generalized references</emphasis> which allows
a reference to have two different formulations, one for internal
references and one for external references. Since LaTeX supports
references to labels in external documents via the <literal>xr</literal> package,
the generalized references in Doconce has a syntax that may utilize
the <literal>xr</literal> feature in LaTeX.</paragraph><paragraph>The syntax of generalized references reads:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">ref[internal][cite][external]</literal_block><paragraph>If all <literal>label`_` references in the text ``internal</literal> are references
to labels in the present document, the above <literal>ref</literal> command is replaced
by the text <literal>internal</literal>. Otherwise, if cite is non-empty and the format
is <literal>latex</literal> or <literal>pdflatex</literal> one assumes that the references in <literal>internal</literal>
are to external documents declared by a comment line <literal>#
Externaldocuments: testdoc, mydoc</literal> (usually after the title, authors,
and date). In this case the output text is <literal>internal cite</literal> and the
LaTeX package <literal>xr</literal> is used to handle the labels in the external documents.
If none of the two situations above applies, the <literal>external</literal>
text will be the output.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is an example on a specific generalized reference:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">As explained in

surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}</literal_block><paragraph>Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: <literal>idx</literal>
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the

Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).</paragraph><paragraph>Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.</literal_block><paragraph>Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding <literal>cite</literal> command; in reST

formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">as found in [3][14]</literal_block><paragraph>if <literal>Larsen_1986</literal> has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document

followed by a BibTeX file with extension <literal>.bib</literal>,
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension <literal>.rst</literal>,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension <literal>.py</literal>.

<emphasis>exercise</emphasis>, <emphasis>problem</emphasis>, <emphasis>project</emphasis>, or <emphasis>example</emphasis>.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection
headline, 5 <literal>=</literal> characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word &quot;Exercise&quot;, &quot;Problem&quot;, &quot;Project&quot;, or &quot;Example&quot;, followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
in) and a solution file. The Doconce code looks like this:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====
label{proj:moondist}
file=earth2moon.pdf
solution=eart2moon_sol.do.txt

Here goes the running text of the project....</literal_block><paragraph>Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, project, or example <emphasis>title</emphasis>,
the <emphasis>label</emphasis>, the <emphasis>result file</emphasis>, the <emphasis>solution</emphasis> (if any of
these three entities is present), and the <emphasis>running text</emphasis>. In addition,
one can add subexercise environments, starting with <literal>!bsubex</literal> and ending
with <literal>!esubex</literal>, on the beginning of separate lines.
Within the main exercise or
a subexercise, three other environments are possible: (full) solution,
(short) <emphasis>answer</emphasis>, and <emphasis>hints</emphasis>. The environments have begin-end
directives <literal>!bans</literal>, <literal>!eans</literal>, <literal>!bsol</literal>, <literal>!esol</literal>, <literal>!bhint</literal>, <literal>!ehint</literal>, which
all must appear on the beginning of a separate line (just as
<literal>!bc</literal> and <literal>!ec</literal>).</paragraph><paragraph>The solution environment allows inline
solution as an alternative to the <literal>solution=...</literal> directive mentioned above,
which requires that the solution is in a separate file. Comment lines
are inserted so that the beginning and end of answers and solutions can
be identified and removed if desired.</paragraph><paragraph>A full exercise set-up can be sketched as follows:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">===== Exercise: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====

and give some perspectives. The text inside the !bremarks-!eremarks
directives is always typeset at the end of the exercise.

Here goes a full solution of the whole exercise.
!esol</literal_block><paragraph>A recommended rule for using the different &quot;exercise&quot; types goes as follows:</paragraph><block_quote><bullet_list bullet="*"><list_item><paragraph>Exercises are smaller problems directly related to the present chapter
(e.g., with references to the text).</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Problems are sufficiently independent of the chapter's text
that they make sense on their own, separated from the rest of the docoment.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Projects are larger problems that also make sense on their own.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Examples are exercises, problems, or projects with full solutions.</paragraph></list_item></bullet_list></block_quote><paragraph>The command line options <literal>--without-answers</literal> and <literal>--without-solutions</literal>
turn off output of answers and solutions, respectively, except for
examples.</paragraph><paragraph>Sometimes one does not want the heading of an exercise, problem, project,
or example to contain the keyword <literal>Exercise:</literal>, <literal>Problem:</literal>, <literal>Project:</literal>,
or <literal>Example:</literal>. By enclosing the keyword in braces, as in:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">===== {Problem}: Find a solution to a problem =====</literal_block><paragraph>the keyword is marked for being left out of the heading, resulting in
the heading &quot;Find a solution to a problem&quot;.</paragraph><paragraph>The various elements of exercises are collected in a special data
structure (list of dictionaries) stored in a file <literal>.mydoc.exerinfo</literal>,
if <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal> is the name of the Doconce file.  The file contains
a list of dictionaries, where keys in the dictionary corresponds to
elements in the exercise: filename, solution file, answer, label, list
of hints, list of subexercises, closing remarks, and the main body of
text. From this data structure it is easy to generate stand-alone
documents with exercises, problems, and projects with or without
short answers and full solutions.</paragraph><paragraph>Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats can make
use of the elements in an exercise.  For example, one can image web
formats where the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where
the result file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for
downloading the solution file if the result file meets certain
criteria.  Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any
output format, but this is an intended future feature to be
impelemented.</paragraph><paragraph>For now, exercises, problems, projects, examples are typeset as ordinary
Doconce sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
formats). One must therefore refer to an exercise, problem, project, or
example by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The <emphasis>title</emphasis> is typeset without any leading &quot;Exercise:&quot;, &quot;Problem:&quot;,
or &quot;Project:&quot; word, so that references like:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">see Problem ref{...}</literal_block><paragraph>works well in all formats (i.e., no double &quot;Problem Problem&quot; appears).</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Remark.</emphasis> Examples are <emphasis>not</emphasis> typeset similarly to exercises unless one adds
the command-line option <literal>--examples-as-exercises</literal>. That is, without
this option, any heading and starting with <literal>Example:</literal> makes Doconce
treat the forthcoming text as ordinary text without any interpretation
of exercise-style instructions.
With the command-line option <literal>--examples-as-exercises</literal>,
one can use the <literal>!bsubex</literal> and <literal>!bsol</literal>
commands to indicate a subproblem and a solution. In this way, the
typesetting of the example looks like an exercise equipped with a solution.</paragraph><target refid="sec-verbatim-blocks"/></section><section ids="blocks-of-verbatim-computer-code sec-verbatim-blocks" names="blocks\ of\ verbatim\ computer\ code sec:verbatim:blocks"><title>Blocks of Verbatim Computer Code</title><paragraph>Blocks of computer code, to be typeset verbatim, must appear inside a
&quot;begin code&quot; <literal>!bc</literal> keyword and an &quot;end code&quot; <literal>!ec</literal> keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and <emphasis>start at the beginning of the
line</emphasis>.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is a plain code block:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">!bc

% And some data
1.003 1.025
2.204 1.730
3.001 1.198</literal_block><paragraph>There may be an argument after the <literal>!bc</literal> tag to specify a certain
environment (for <literal>ptex2tex</literal>, <literal>doconce ptex2tex</literal>, or Sphinx) for
typesetting the verbatim code. For instance, <literal>!bc dat</literal> corresponds to
the data file environment and <literal>!bc cod</literal> is typically used for a code
snippet. There are some predefined environments explained below. If
there is no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some
plain verbatim typesetting (for <literal>ptex2tex</literal> this means the <literal>ccq</literal>
environment, which is defined in the config file <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal>,
while for Sphinx it defaults to the <literal>python</literal> environment).</paragraph><paragraph>Since the config file for <literal>ptex2tex</literal> and command-line arguments for
the alternative <literal>doconce ptex2tex</literal> program can define what some environments
map onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after <literal>!bc</literal> is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve"># sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console</literal_block><paragraph>Here, three arguments are defined: <literal>pycod</literal> for Python code,
<literal>cod</literal> also for Python code, <literal>cppcod</literal> for C++ code, and <literal>sys</literal>
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal> for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).</paragraph><paragraph>By default, <literal>pro</literal> is used for complete programs in Python, <literal>cod</literal> is
for a code snippet in Python, while <literal>xcod</literal> and <literal>xpro</literal> implies computer
language specific typesetting where <literal>x</literal> can be <literal>f</literal> for Fortran, <literal>c</literal>
for C, <literal>cpp</literal> for C++, <literal>sh</literal> for Unix shells, <literal>pl</literal> for Perl, <literal>m</literal> for
Matlab, <literal>cy</literal> for Cython, and <literal>py</literal> for Python.  The argument <literal>sys</literal>
means by default <literal>console</literal> for Sphinx and <literal>CodeTerminal</literal> (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are <literal>dat</literal> for a data file
or print out, and <literal>ipy</literal> for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in <literal>sphinx</literal> output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after <literal>!bc</literal> can be redefined in the
<literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal> configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
<literal>sphinx code-blocks</literal> comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages
is easily added.</paragraph><comment xml:space="preserve">(Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">and computer languages.

be followed by a newline.  A common error in list environments is to
forget to indent the plain text surrounding the code blocks. In

common errors are naturally avoided).</paragraph><paragraph>Here is a verbatim code block with Python code (<literal>pycod</literal> style):</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">!bc pycod

a plain <literal>!bc</literal> environment.) Two regular expressions, separated by the
<literal>@</literal> sign, define the &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot; lines.  The &quot;from&quot; line is
included in the verbatim block, while the &quot;to&quot; line is not. In the
example above, we copy code from the line matching <literal>subroutine test</literal>

understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
<literal>!bt</literal> and <literal>!et</literal> in <literal>newcommands_keep.tex</literal> to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
<literal>newcommands_replace.tex</literal> and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the <literal>newcommands*.tex</literal> files <emphasis>must</emphasis> appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Example.</emphasis> Suppose we have the following commands in

leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(<reference name="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess">http://code.google.com/p/preprocess</reference><target ids="http-code-google-com-p-preprocess" names="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess"/>) and mako
(<reference name="http://www.makotemplates.org/" refuri="http://www.makotemplates.org/">http://www.makotemplates.org/</reference><target ids="http-www-makotemplates-org" names="http://www.makotemplates.org/" refuri="http://www.makotemplates.org/"/>). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of <literal>name=value</literal> command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.</paragraph><paragraph>Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.</paragraph><paragraph>The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable <literal>FORMAT</literal>
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (<literal>html</literal>, <literal>latex</literal>,
<literal>plain</literal>, <literal>rst</literal>, <literal>sphinx</literal>, <literal>epydoc</literal>, <literal>st</literal>).  It is then easy to test on
the value of <literal>FORMAT</literal> and take different actions for different
formats. Below is an example:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">First some math:

!bt
\begin{align}
x &amp;= 3
label{x:eq1}\\
y &amp;= 5
label{y:eq1}
\end{align}
!et
Let us now reason about this.

# Sphinx cannot refer to labels in align environments

# #if FORMAT in (&quot;latex&quot;, &quot;pdflatex&quot;, &quot;html&quot;)
From (\ref{x:eq})-(\ref{y:eq1}) we get that
# #elif FORMAT == &quot;sphinx&quot;
From
!bt
\[ x = 3 \]
!et
and
!bt
\[ y= 5 \]
!et
it follows that
# #else
From the above equations it follows that
# #endif
$x+y$ is 8.</literal_block><paragraph>Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at
the command line as explained in the section <reference name="From Doconce to Other Formats" refid="from-doconce-to-other-formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</reference>.</paragraph><paragraph>More advanced use of mako can include Python code that may automate
the writing of parts of the document.</paragraph></section><section ids="splitting-documents-into-smaller-pieces" names="splitting\ documents\ into\ smaller\ pieces"><title>Splitting Documents into Smaller Pieces</title><paragraph>Long documents are conveniently split into smaller Doconce files.
However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form <literal>#include &quot;file.do.txt&quot;</literal>.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.</paragraph><paragraph>For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate <literal>.rst</literal> files and an index file listing the various <literal>.rst</literal>
that build up the document. To generate the various <literal>.rst</literal> files one
should not run Doconce on the individual <literal>.do.txt</literal> files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script <literal>doconce split_rst</literal>
to split the long, complete <literal>.rst</literal> into pieces. This process requires
that each <literal>#include &quot;file.do.txt</literal> line in the master file is preceded by a
&quot;marker line&quot; having the syntax <literal>#&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part: file &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</literal>, where
<literal>file</literal> is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword <literal>part:</literal>.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is <literal>master.do.txt</literal>.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part: name &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake_sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi</literal_block><paragraph>The autogenerated <literal>automake_sphinx.sh</literal> file (by <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal>)
is compatible with a master <literal>.rst</literal> file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal>.
This set is the output of <literal>doconce split_rst</literal>, which we catch in a
variable <literal>files</literal> above.</paragraph></section><section ids="missing-features" names="missing\ features"><title>Missing Features</title><paragraph>Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, do something like:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve"># #if FORMAT in (&quot;latex&quot;, &quot;pdflatex&quot;)
# insert native LaTeX code for fancy table
# #else
# insert a Doconce-formatted &quot;inline&quot; table
# #endif</literal_block><paragraph>Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).</paragraph><paragraph>Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.</paragraph></section><section ids="header-and-footer" names="header\ and\ footer"><title>Header and Footer</title><paragraph>Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduced the convention that if <literal>TITLE:</literal>
is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has a title), the header and footer are included, otherwise not.</paragraph><target refid="emacs-doconce"/></section><section ids="emacs-doconce-formatter emacs-doconce" names="emacs\ doconce\ formatter emacs:doconce"><title>Emacs Doconce Formatter</title><paragraph>The file <reference name=".doconce-mode.el" refuri="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/misc/.doconce-mode.el">.doconce-mode.el</reference><target ids="doconce-mode-el" names=".doconce-mode.el" refuri="https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/misc/.doconce-mode.el"/> in the Doconce source distribution

using paragraph headings, which will look satisfactorily in all
formats, but add comment lines that can be replaced by LaTeX environments
via <literal>doconce replace</literal>. Theorems can be numbered using a variable in Mako.
Here is an example on raw Doconce code:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">&lt;%
theorem_counter = 4
%&gt;

# begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}
&lt;%
theorem_counter += 1
theorem_fundamental1 = theorem_counter
%&gt;

__Theorem ${theorem_counter}.__
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
# end theorem

# begin proof
__Proof.__
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$|$END$
# end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem ${theorem_counter} is a modest
achievement.</literal_block><paragraph>The <literal>.p.tex</literal> output file now reads:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">% begin theorem
label{theorem:fundamental1}


\paragraph{Theorem 5.}
Let $a=1$ and $b=2$. Then $c=3$.
% end theorem

% begin proof
\paragraph{Proof.}
Since $c=a+b$, the result follows from straightforward addition.
$\Diamond$
% end proof

As we see, the proof of Theorem 5 is a modest
achievement.</literal_block><paragraph>Note that with Mako variables we can easily create our own counters,

the proper LaTeX expressions in the <literal>.p.tex</literal> file. Moreover, we

The following Bash script does the job:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">file=mydoc.p.tex
thpack='\\usepackage{theorem}\n\\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[section]'
doconce subst '% insert custom LaTeX commands\.\.\.' $thpack $file
doconce subst '\\paragraph\{Theorem \d+\.\}' '' $file
doconce replace '% begin theorem' '\begin{theorem}' $file
doconce replace '% end theorem' '\end{theorem}' $file</literal_block><paragraph>More heavy editing is better done in a Python script that reads the
<literal>mydoc.p.tex</literal> file and performs string substitutions and regex
substitutions as needed.</paragraph><paragraph>The resulting <literal>mydoc.tex</literal> file now becomes:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">\usepackage{theorem}

HTML template. The Doconce source is then the body of text (leave
out <literal>TITLE:</literal> to get HTML without a header and footer). The
<literal>--html-template=filename</literal> command-line option will then embed the
Doconce text in the specified template file, where you can use style
sheets and desired constructs in the header and footer.
The template can have &quot;slots&quot; for a title (<literal>%(title)s</literal>),
a date (<literal>%(date)s</literal>), and the main body of text (<literal>%(main)s</literal>).
For typesetting code, <literal>pygments</literal> is used (if installed) and can be

figure captions and the horizontal rule above figures. When using

simply by automatic editing of the HTML code in a little shell script:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">doconce replace '&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;' \

<literal>_doconce_debugging.log</literal>, if the to <literal>doconce format</literal> after the filename
is <literal>debug</literal>. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section &quot;Basic Parsing
Ideas&quot; explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.</paragraph></section></section><section ids="basic-parsing-ideas" names="basic\ parsing\ ideas"><title>Basic Parsing Ideas</title><comment xml:space="preserve">avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea)</comment><paragraph>The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in

handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">(?P&lt;indent&gt; *(?P&lt;listtype&gt;[*o-] )? *)(?P&lt;keyword&gt;[^:]+?:)?(?P&lt;text&gt;.*)\s?</literal_block><paragraph>That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.</paragraph><paragraph>When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.</paragraph><paragraph>The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).</paragraph><paragraph>It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.</paragraph><section ids="typesetting-of-function-arguments-return-values-and-variables" names="typesetting\ of\ function\ arguments,\ return\ values,\ and\ variables"><title>Typesetting of Function Arguments, Return Values, and Variables</title><paragraph>As part of comments (or doc strings) in computer code one often wishes
to explain what a function takes of arguments and what the return
values are. Similarly, it is desired to document class, instance, and
module variables.  Such arguments/variables can be typeset as
description lists of the form listed below and <emphasis>placed at the end of
the doc string</emphasis>. Note that <literal>argument</literal>, <literal>keyword argument</literal>, <literal>return</literal>,
<literal>instance variable</literal>, <literal>class variable</literal>, and <literal>module variable</literal> are the
only legal keywords (descriptions) for the description list in this
context.  If the output format is Epytext (Epydoc) or Sphinx, such lists of
arguments and variables are nicely formatted:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">- argument x: x value (float),
  which must be a positive number.
- keyword argument tolerance: tolerance (float) for stopping
  the iterations.
- return: the root of the equation (float), if found, otherwise None.
- instance variable eta: surface elevation (array).
- class variable items: the total number of MyClass objects (int).
- module variable debug: True: debug mode is on; False: no debugging
  (bool variable).</literal_block><paragraph>The result depends on the output format: all formats except Epytext
