looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
including HTML, Pandoc, Google wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText
(reST), Sphinx, Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious
formatting/tags are removed for clear reading in, e.g.,
emails). From reST you can (via <literal>rst2*</literal> programs) go to XML, HTML,
LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the latter (via <literal>unoconv</literal>) to
RTF, numerous MS Word formats (including MS Office Open XML),
DocBook, PDF, MediaWiki, XHTML. From Pandoc one can generate
Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML, OpenOffice, GNU
Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
The slogan is: &quot;Write once, include anywhere&quot;.</paragraph></list_item></enumerated_list></block_quote><paragraph>Here are some Doconce features:</paragraph><block_quote><bullet_list bullet="*"><list_item><paragraph>Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than
Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than
LaTeX and HTML.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce can be converted to plain <emphasis>untagged</emphasis> text,
often desirable for computer programs and email.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code
directly from the source code files via regular expressions
for the start and end lines.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce has full support for LaTeX math and integrates well
with big LaTeX projects (books).</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
as Google wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or wiki document.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Contrary to the similar (and superior) Pandoc translator, Doconce
supports Sphinx, Google wiki, Creole wiki (for bitbucket.org),
lots of computer code environments in LaTeX, and a special exercise
syntax. Doconce also also runs preprocessors (including Mako)
such that the author can mix ordinary text with programming
construction for generating parts of the text.</paragraph></list_item></bullet_list></block_quote><paragraph>Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:</paragraph><block_quote><bullet_list bullet="*"><list_item><paragraph>Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, wiki, or MS Word.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
Sphinx web pages, MS Word documents, or in wikis.</paragraph></list_item></bullet_list></block_quote><paragraph>History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.</paragraph><paragraph>Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting of Doconce syntax
may face problems when transformed to HTML, LaTeX, Sphinx, and similar
formats.</paragraph></section><section ids="installation-of-doconce-and-its-dependencies" names="installation\ of\ doconce\ and\ its\ dependencies"><title>Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies</title><section ids="doconce" names="doconce"><title>Doconce</title><paragraph>Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at <reference name="http://code.google.com/p/doconce" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/doconce">http://code.google.com/p/doconce</reference><target ids="http-code-google-com-p-doconce" names="http://code.google.com/p/doconce" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/doconce"/>.  Its installation from the

hg clone https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install

Terminal&gt; doconce format latex yourdoc extra_sections=True VAR1=5  # mako</literal_block><paragraph>The variable <literal>FORMAT</literal> is always defined as the current format when
running <literal>preprocess</literal>. That is, in the last example, <literal>FORMAT</literal> is
defined as <literal>latex</literal>. Inside the Doconce document one can then perform
format specific actions through tests like <literal>#if FORMAT == &quot;latex&quot;</literal>.</paragraph><paragraph>Inline comments in the text are removed from the output by:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc --skip_inline_comments</literal_block><paragraph>One can also remove all such comments from the original Doconce

From this format one can go to numerous other formats:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; pandoc -R -t mediawiki -o mydoc.mwk mydoc.mkd</literal_block><paragraph>Pandoc supports <literal>latex</literal>, <literal>html</literal>, <literal>odt</literal> (OpenOffice), <literal>docx</literal> (Microsoft
Word), <literal>rtf</literal>, <literal>texinfo</literal>, to mention some. The <literal>-R</literal> option makes
Pandoc pass raw HTML or LaTeX to the output format instead of ignoring it.
See the <reference name="Pandoc documentation" refuri="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc documentation</reference><target ids="pandoc-documentation" names="pandoc\ documentation" refuri="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html"/>
for the many features of the <literal>pandoc</literal> program.</paragraph><paragraph>Pandoc is useful to go from LaTeX mathematics to, e.g., HTML or MS Word.
There are two ways (experiment to find the best one for your document):
<literal>doconce format pandoc</literal> and then translating using <literal>pandoc</literal>, or
<literal>doconce format latex</literal>, and then going from LaTeX to the desired format
using <literal>pandoc</literal>.
Here is an example on the latter strategy:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc
Terminal&gt; pandoc -f latex -t docx -o mydoc.docx mydoc.tex</literal_block><paragraph>When we go through <literal>pandoc</literal>, only single equations or <literal>align*</literal>
environments are well understood.</paragraph><paragraph>Quite some <literal>doconce replace</literal> and <literal>doconce subst</literal> edits might be needed
on the <literal>.mkd</literal> or <literal>.tex</literal> files to successfully have mathematics that is
well translated to MS Word.  Also when going to reStructuredText using
Pandoc, it can be advantageous to go via LaTeX.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is an example where we take a Doconce snippet (without title, author,
and date), maybe with some unnumbered equations, and quickly generate
HTML with mathematics displayed my MathJax:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format pandoc mydoc
Terminal&gt; pandoc -t html -o mydoc.html -s --mathjax mydoc.mkd</literal_block><paragraph>The <literal>-s</literal> option adds a proper header and footer to the <literal>mydoc.html</literal> file.
This recipe is a quick way of makeing HTML notes with (some) mathematics.</paragraph></section><section ids="latex" names="latex"><title>LaTeX</title><paragraph>Making a LaTeX file <literal>mydoc.tex</literal> from <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal> is done in two steps:
.. Note: putting code blocks inside a list is not successful in many</paragraph><comment xml:space="preserve">formats - the text may be messed up. A better choice is a paragraph</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">environment, as used here.</comment><paragraph><emphasis>Step 1.</emphasis> Filter the doconce text to a pre-LaTeX form <literal>mydoc.p.tex</literal> for
the <literal>ptex2tex</literal> program (or <literal>doconce ptex2tex</literal>):</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format latex mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>LaTeX-specific commands (&quot;newcommands&quot;) in math formulas and similar
can be placed in files <literal>newcommands.tex</literal>, <literal>newcommands_keep.tex</literal>, or
<literal>newcommands_replace.tex</literal> (see the section <reference name="Macros (Newcommands)" refid="macros-newcommands">Macros (Newcommands)</reference>).
If these files are present, they are included in the LaTeX document
so that your commands are defined.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 2.</emphasis> Run <literal>ptex2tex</literal> (if you have it) to make a standard LaTeX file:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; ptex2tex mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>In case you do not have <literal>ptex2tex</literal>, you may run a (very) simplified version:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>Note that Doconce generates a <literal>.p.tex</literal> file with some preprocessor macros
that can be used to steer certain properties of the LaTeX document.
For example, to turn on the Helvetica font instead of the standard
Computer Modern font, run:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; ptex2tex -DHELVETICA mydoc
Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DHELVETICA  # alternative</literal_block><paragraph>The title, authors, and date are by default typeset in a non-standard
way to enable a nicer treatment of multiple authors having
institutions in common. However, the standard LaTeX &quot;maketitle&quot; heading
is also available through <literal>-DLATEX_HEADING=traditional</literal>.
A separate titlepage can be generate by
<literal>-DLATEX_HEADING=titlepage</literal>.</paragraph><paragraph>Other preprocessor variables are <literal>BOOK</literal> for the &quot;book&quot; documentclass
rather than the standard &quot;article&quot; (necessary if you apply chapter
headings), <literal>PALATINO</literal> for the palatino font, <literal>A4PAPER</literal> for A4 paper
size, <literal>A6PAPER</literal> for A6 paper size (suitable for reading on small
devices), <literal>MOVIE15</literal> for inclusion of the movie15 LaTeX package, and
<literal>MINTED</literal> for inclusion of the minted package (which requires <literal>latex</literal>
or <literal>pdflatex</literal> to be run with the <literal>-shell-escape</literal> option).</paragraph><paragraph>The <literal>ptex2tex</literal> tool makes it possible to easily switch between many
different fancy formattings of computer or verbatim code in LaTeX
documents. After any <literal>!bc</literal> command in the Doconce source you can
insert verbatim block styles as defined in your <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal>
file, e.g., <literal>!bc sys</literal> for a terminal session, where <literal>sys</literal> is set to
a certain environment in <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal> (e.g., <literal>CodeTerminal</literal>).
There are about 40 styles to choose from, and you can easily add
new ones.</paragraph><paragraph>Also the <literal>doconce ptex2tex</literal> command supports preprocessor directives
for processing the <literal>.p.tex</literal> file. The command allows specifications
of code environments as well. Here is an example:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce ptex2tex mydoc -DLATEX_HEADING=traditional \
          -DPALATINO -DA6PAPER \
          &quot;sys=\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}@\end{verbatim}\end{quote}&quot; \
          fpro=minted fcod=minted shcod=Verbatim envir=ans:nt</literal_block><paragraph>Note that <literal>@</literal> must be used to separate the begin and end LaTeX
commands, unless only the environment name is given (such as <literal>minted</literal>
above, which implies <literal>\begin{minted}{fortran}</literal> and <literal>\end{minted}</literal> as
begin and end for blocks inside <literal>!bc fpro</literal> and <literal>!ec</literal>).  Specifying
<literal>envir=ans:nt</literal> means that all other environments are typeset with the
<literal>anslistings.sty</literal> package, e.g., <literal>!bc cppcod</literal> will then result in
<literal>\begin{c++}</literal>. If no environments like <literal>sys</literal>, <literal>fpro</literal>, or the common
<literal>envir</literal> are defined on the command line, the plain <literal>\begin{verbatim}</literal>
and <literal>\end{verbatim}</literal> used.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 2b (optional).</emphasis> Edit the <literal>mydoc.tex</literal> file to your needs.
For example, you may want to substitute <literal>section</literal> by <literal>section*</literal> to
avoid numbering of sections, you may want to insert linebreaks
(and perhaps space) in the title, etc. This can be automatically
edited with the aid of the <literal>doconce replace</literal> and <literal>doconce subst</literal>
commands. The former works with substituting text directly, while the
latter performs substitutions using regular expressions.
Here are two examples:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce replace 'section{' 'section*{' mydoc.tex
Terminal&gt; doconce subst 'title\{(.+)Using (.+)\}' \
          'title{\g&lt;1&gt; \\\\ [1.5mm] Using \g&lt;2&gt;' mydoc.tex</literal_block><paragraph>A lot of tailored fixes to the LaTeX document can be done by
an appropriate set of text replacements and regular expression
substitutions. You are anyway encourged to make a script for
generating PDF from the LaTeX file.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 3.</emphasis> Compile <literal>mydoc.tex</literal>
and create the PDF file:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal&gt; bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal&gt; latex mydoc
Terminal&gt; dvipdf mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>If one wishes to run <literal>ptex2tex</literal> and use the minted LaTeX package for
typesetting code blocks (<literal>Minted_Python</literal>, <literal>Minted_Cpp</literal>, etc., in
<literal>ptex2tex</literal> specified through the <literal>*pro</literal> and <literal>*cod</literal> variables in
<literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal> or <literal>$HOME/.ptex2tex.cfg</literal>), the minted LaTeX package is
needed.  This package is included by running <literal>ptex2tex</literal> with the
<literal>-DMINTED</literal> option:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; ptex2tex -DMINTED mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>In this case, <literal>latex</literal> must be run with the
<literal>-shell-escape</literal> option:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; makeindex mydoc   # if index
Terminal&gt; bibitem mydoc     # if bibliography
Terminal&gt; latex -shell-escape mydoc
Terminal&gt; dvipdf mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>When running <literal>doconce ptex2tex mydoc envir=minted</literal> (or other minted

We have automated
most of the steps through the <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> command:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir author=&quot;authors' names&quot; \
          title=&quot;some title&quot; version=1.0 dirname=sphinxdir \
          theme=mytheme file1 file2 file3 ...</literal_block><paragraph>The keywords <literal>author</literal>, <literal>title</literal>, and <literal>version</literal> are used in the headings
of the Sphinx document. By default, <literal>version</literal> is 1.0 and the script
will try to deduce authors and title from the doconce files <literal>file1</literal>,
<literal>file2</literal>, etc. that together represent the whole document. Note that
none of the individual Doconce files <literal>file1</literal>, <literal>file2</literal>, etc. should
include the rest as their union makes up the whole document.
The default value of <literal>dirname</literal> is <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>. The <literal>theme</literal>
keyword is used to set the theme for design of HTML output from
Sphinx (the default theme is <literal>'default'</literal>).</paragraph><paragraph>With a single-file document in <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal> one often just runs:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce sphinx_dir mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>and then an appropriate Sphinx directory <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal> is made with
relevant files.</paragraph><paragraph>The <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> command generates a script
<literal>automake-sphinx.py</literal> for compiling the Sphinx document into an HTML
document.  One can either run <literal>automake-sphinx.py</literal> or perform the
steps in the script manually, possibly with necessary modifications.
You should at least read the script prior to executing it to have
some idea of what is done.</paragraph><paragraph>The <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> script copies directories named <literal>figs</literal> or
<literal>figures</literal> over to the Sphinx directory so that figures are accessible
in the Sphinx compilation.  If figures or movies are located in other
directories, <literal>automake-sphinx.py</literal> must be edited accordingly.  Files,
to which there are local links (not <literal>http:</literal> or <literal>file:</literal> URLs), must be
placed in the <literal>_static</literal> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory. The
utility <literal>doconce sphinxfix_localURLs</literal> is run to check for local links
in the Doconce file: for each such link, say <literal>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</literal> it
replaces the link by <literal>_static/myfile.txt</literal> and copies
<literal>dir1/dir2/myfile.txt</literal> to a local <literal>_static</literal> directory (in the same
directory as the script is run).  However, we recommend instead that
the writer of the document places files in <literal>_static</literal> or lets a script
do it automatically. The user must copy all <literal>_static/*</literal> files to the
<literal>_static</literal> subdirectory of the Sphinx directory.  It may be wise to
always put files, to which there are local links in the Doconce
document, in a <literal>_static</literal> or <literal>_static-name</literal> directory and use these
local links. Then links do not need to be modified when creating a
Sphinx version of the document.</paragraph><paragraph>Doconce comes with a collection of HTML themes for Sphinx documents.
These are packed out in the Sphinx directory, the <literal>conf.py</literal>
configuration file for Sphinx is edited accordingly, and a script
<literal>make-themes.sh</literal> can make HTML documents with one or more themes.
For example,
to realize the themes <literal>fenics</literal> and <literal>pyramid</literal>, one writes:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; ./make-themes.sh fenics pyramid</literal_block><paragraph>The resulting directories with HTML documents are <literal>_build/html_fenics</literal>
and <literal>_build/html_pyramid</literal>, respectively. Without arguments,
<literal>make-themes.sh</literal> makes all available themes (!).</paragraph><paragraph>If it is not desirable to use the autogenerated scripts explained
above, here is the complete manual procedure of generating a
Sphinx document from a file <literal>mydoc.do.txt</literal>.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 1.</emphasis> Translate Doconce into the Sphinx format:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format sphinx mydoc</literal_block><paragraph><emphasis>Step 2.</emphasis> Create a Sphinx root directory
either manually or by using the interactive <literal>sphinx-quickstart</literal>
program. Here is a scripted version of the steps with the latter:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">mkdir sphinx-rootdir

may need some edits if you want to specific layout (Sphinx themes)
of HTML pages. The <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal> generator makes an extended <literal>conv.py</literal>
file where, among other things, several useful Sphinx extensions
are included.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 3.</emphasis> Copy the <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> file to the Sphinx root directory:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; cp mydoc.rst sphinx-rootdir</literal_block><paragraph>If you have figures in your document, the relative paths to those will
be invalid when you work with <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> in the <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>
directory. Either edit <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> so that figure file paths are correct,
or simply copy your figure directories to <literal>sphinx-rootdir</literal>.
Links to local files in <literal>mydoc.rst</literal> must be modified to links to
files in the <literal>_static</literal> directory, see comment above.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 4.</emphasis> Edit the generated <literal>index.rst</literal> file so that <literal>mydoc.rst</literal>
is included, i.e., add <literal>mydoc</literal> to the <literal>toctree</literal> section so that it becomes:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mydoc</literal_block><paragraph>(The spaces before <literal>mydoc</literal> are important!)</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 5.</emphasis> Generate, for instance, an HTML version of the Sphinx source:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">make clean   # remove old versions
make html</literal_block><paragraph>Sphinx can generate a range of different formats:
standalone HTML, HTML in separate directories with <literal>index.html</literal> files,
a large single HTML file, JSON files, various help files (the qthelp, HTML,
and Devhelp projects), epub, LaTeX, PDF (via LaTeX), pure text, man pages,
and Texinfo files.</paragraph><paragraph><emphasis>Step 6.</emphasis> View the result:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; firefox _build/html/index.html</literal_block><paragraph>Note that verbatim code blocks can be typeset in a variety of ways
depending the argument that follows <literal>!bc</literal>: <literal>cod</literal> gives Python
(<literal>code-block:: python</literal> in Sphinx syntax) and <literal>cppcod</literal> gives C++, but
all such arguments can be customized both for Sphinx and LaTeX output.</paragraph></section><section ids="wiki-formats" names="wiki\ formats"><title>Wiki Formats</title><paragraph>There are many different wiki formats, but Doconce only supports three:
<reference name="Googlecode wiki" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax">Googlecode wiki</reference><target ids="googlecode-wiki" names="googlecode\ wiki" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax"/>, MediaWiki, and Creole Wiki. These formats are called
<literal>gwiki</literal>, <literal>mwiki</literal>, and <literal>cwiki</literal>, respectively.
Transformation from Doconce to these formats is done by:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce format gwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal&gt; doconce format mwiki mydoc.do.txt
Terminal&gt; doconce format cwiki mydoc.do.txt</literal_block><paragraph>The Googlecode wiki document, <literal>mydoc.gwiki</literal>, is most conveniently stored
in a directory which is a clone of the wiki part of the Googlecode project.
This is far easier than copying and pasting the entire text into the
wiki editor in a web browser.</paragraph><paragraph>When the Doconce file contains figures, each figure filename must in
the <literal>.gwiki</literal> file be replaced by a URL where the figure is
available. There are instructions in the file for doing this. Usually,
one performs this substitution automatically (see next section).</paragraph><paragraph>From the MediaWiki format one can go to other formats with aid
of <reference name="mwlib" refuri="http://pediapress.com/code/">mwlib</reference><target ids="mwlib" names="mwlib" refuri="http://pediapress.com/code/"/>. This means that one can
easily use Doconce to write <reference name="Wikibooks" refuri="http://en.wikibooks.org">Wikibooks</reference><target ids="wikibooks" names="wikibooks" refuri="http://en.wikibooks.org"/>
and publish these in PDF and MediaWiki format.
At the same time, the book can also be published as a
standard LaTeX book or a Sphinx web document.</paragraph></section><section ids="tweaking-the-doconce-output" names="tweaking\ the\ doconce\ output"><title>Tweaking the Doconce Output</title><paragraph>Occasionally, one would like to tweak the output in a certain format
from Doconce. One example is figure filenames when transforming
Doconce to reStructuredText. Since Doconce does not know if the
<literal>.rst</literal> file is going to be filtered to LaTeX or HTML, it cannot know
if <literal>.eps</literal> or <literal>.png</literal> is the most appropriate image filename.
The solution is to use a text substitution command or code with, e.g., sed,
perl, python, or scitools subst, to automatically edit the output file
from Doconce. It is then wise to run Doconce and the editing commands
from a script to automate all steps in going from Doconce to the final
format(s). The <literal>make.sh</literal> files in <literal>docs/manual</literal> and <literal>docs/tutorial</literal>
constitute comprehensive examples on how such scripts can be made.</paragraph></section></section><section ids="the-doconce-markup-language" names="the\ doconce\ markup\ language"><title>The Doconce Markup Language</title><paragraph>The Doconce format introduces four constructs to markup text:

files to a <literal>_static</literal> or <literal>_static-name</literal> directory and makes links to
files in this directory only (<literal>name</literal> is the nickname of the Doconce
document, usually the name of the parent directory or main document).
Other links to files should use the full URL (unless one knows that
only the <literal>html</literal> format is of relevance).</paragraph><paragraph>If you want a link to a local source code file and have it
viewed in the browser rather than being downloaded, we recommend
to transform the source code file to HTML format by running

plain text text. (<strong>hpl</strong>: Note that there must be a space after the colon,
otherwise the comment is not recognized. Inline comments
can span
several lines,
if desired.)
The name and comment are visible in the output unless <literal>doconce format</literal>
is run with a command-line argument <literal>--skip_inline_comments</literal>
(see the chapter <reference name="From Doconce to Other Formats" refid="from-doconce-to-other-formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</reference> for an example). Inline comments
are helpful during development of a document since different authors
and readers can comment on formulations, missing points, etc.
All such comments can easily be removed from the <literal>.do.txt</literal> file
(see the chapter <reference name="From Doconce to Other Formats" refid="from-doconce-to-other-formats">From Doconce to Other Formats</reference>).</paragraph><paragraph>Inline mathematics is written as in LaTeX, i.e., inside dollar signs.
Many formats leave this syntax as it is (including to dollar signs),
hence nice math formatting is only obtained in LaTeX, HTML, MediaWiki,
and Sphinx (Epytext has some inline math support that is utilized).
However, mathematical expressions in LaTeX syntax often contains
special formatting commands, which may appear annoying in plain
text. Doconce therefore supports an extended inline math syntax where
the writer can provide an alternative syntax suited for formats close
to plain ASCII:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Here is an example on a linear system
${\bf A}{\bf x} = {\bf b}$|$Ax=b$,
where $\bf A$|$A$ is an $n\times n$|$nxn$ matrix, and
$\bf x$|$x$ and $\bf b$|$b$ are vectors of length $n$|$n$.</literal_block><paragraph>That is, we provide two alternative expressions, both enclosed in
dollar signs and separated by a pipe symbol, the expression to the
left is used in formats with LaTeX support (<literal>latex</literal>, <literal>pdflatex</literal>, <literal>html</literal>,
<literal>sphinx</literal>, <literal>mwiki</literal>), while the expression to the right is used for
all other formats.  The above text is typeset as &quot;Here is an example
on a linear system Ax=b, where A
is an nxn matrix, and x and b
are vectors of length n.&quot;</paragraph></section><section ids="comments" names="comments"><title>Comments</title><paragraph>Comments intended to be visible in the output document and read by
readers are known as <emphasis>inline comments</emphasis> in Doconce and described
in the section <reference name="Inline Tagging" refid="id5">Inline Tagging</reference>.</paragraph><paragraph>Here we address comments in the Doconce source file that are not
intended to be visible in the output document. Basic comment
lines start with the hash <literal>#</literal>:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">#
# Here are some comment lines that do not affect any formatting.
# These lines are converted to comments in the output format.
#</literal_block><paragraph>Such comment lines may have some side effects in the <literal>rst</literal> and <literal>sphinx</literal>
formats because following lines are taken as part of the comment if
there is not a blank line after the comment.</paragraph><paragraph>The Mako preprocessor supports comments that are filtered out <emphasis>before</emphasis>
Doconce starts translating the document. Such comments are very valuable
as they will never interfere with the output format and they are only
present in the Doconce source. Mako has two types of comments:
lines starting with a double hash <literal>##</literal> and lines enclosed by
the <literal>&lt;%doc&gt;</literal> (beginning) and <literal>&lt;%doc/&gt;</literal> (closing) tags.</paragraph><paragraph>If you need a lot of comments in the Doconce file, consider using
Mako comments instead of the single hash, unless you want to
comments to be in the source code of the output document.</paragraph></section><section ids="cross-referencing" names="cross-referencing"><title>Cross-Referencing</title><paragraph>References and labels are supported. The syntax is simple:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">label{section:verbatim}   # defines a label
For more information we refer to Section ref{section:verbatim}.</literal_block><paragraph>This syntax is close that that of labels and cross-references in
LaTeX. When the label is placed after a section or subsection heading,
the plain text, Epytext, and StructuredText formats will simply
replace the reference by the title of the (sub)section.  All labels
will become invisible, except those in math environments.  In the
<literal>rst</literal> and <literal>sphinx</literal> formats, the end effect is the same, but
the &quot;label&quot; and &quot;ref&quot; commands are first translated to the proper
reST commands by <literal>doconce format</literal>. In the HTML and (Google
Code) wiki formats, labels become anchors and references become links,
and with LaTeX &quot;label&quot; and &quot;ref&quot; are just equipped with backslashes so
these commands work as usual in LaTeX.</paragraph><paragraph>It is, in general, recommended to use labels and references for
(sub)sections, equations, and figures only.
By the way, here is an example on referencing Figure <reference name="fig:viz" refid="fig-viz">fig:viz</reference>
(the label appears in the figure caption in the source code of this document).
Additional references to the sections <reference name="LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text" refid="latex-blocks-of-mathematical-text">LaTeX Blocks of Mathematical Text</reference> and <reference name="Macros (Newcommands)" refid="macros-newcommands">Macros (Newcommands)</reference> are
nice to demonstrate, as well as a reference to equations,
say Equation (my:eq1)--Equation (my:eq2). A comparison of the output and
the source of this document illustrates how labels and references
are handled by the format in question.</paragraph><paragraph>Hyperlinks to files or web addresses are handled as explained
in the section <reference name="Inline Tagging" refid="id5">Inline Tagging</reference>.</paragraph></section><section ids="index-and-bibliography" names="index\ and\ bibliography"><title>Index and Bibliography</title><paragraph>An index can be created for the <literal>latex</literal>, <literal>rst</literal>, and <literal>sphinx</literal> formats

surround verbatim text, which is correctly transformed in a LaTeX setting to:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">\index{verbatim\_text@\texttt{\rm\smaller verbatim\_text and more}}</literal_block><paragraph>Everything related to the index simply becomes invisible in plain
text, Epytext, StructuredText, HTML, and wiki formats.  Note: <literal>idx</literal>
commands should be inserted outside paragraphs, not in between the
text as this may cause some strange behaviour of reST and
Sphinx formatting.  As a recommended rule, index items are naturally
placed right after section headings, before the text begins, while
index items related to a paragraph should be placed above the
paragraph one a separate line (and not in between the text or between
the paragraph heading and the text body, although this works fine if
LaTeX is the output format).</paragraph><paragraph>Literature citations also follow a LaTeX-inspired style:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">as found in cite{Larsen_1986,Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999}.</literal_block><paragraph>Citation labels can be separated by comma. In LaTeX, this is directly
translated to the corresponding <literal>cite</literal> command; in reST
and Sphinx the labels can be clicked, while in all the other text
formats the labels are consecutively numbered so the above citation
will typically look like:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">as found in [3][14]</literal_block><paragraph>if <literal>Larsen_1986</literal> has already appeared in the 3rd citation in the document
and <literal>Nielsen_Kjeldstrup_1999</literal> is a new (the 14th) citation. The citation labels
can be any sequence of characters, except for curly braces and comma.</paragraph><paragraph>The bibliography itself is specified by the special keyword <literal>BIBFILE:</literal>,
followed by a BibTeX file with extension <literal>.bib</literal>,
a corresponding reST bibliography with extension <literal>.rst</literal>,
or simply a Python dictionary written in a file with extension <literal>.py</literal>.
The dictionary in the latter file should have the citation labels as
keys, with corresponding values as the full reference text for an item
in the bibliography. Doconce markup can be used in this text, e.g.:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">{

alignment of the columns (centered, right, or left, respectively).
Similar character can be inserted in the line above the header to

vertical rules in LaTeX tables (they are ignored for other formats).
Note that not all formats offer alignment of heading or entries
in tables (<literal>rst</literal> and <literal>sphinx</literal> are examples). Also note that
Doconce tables are very simple: neither entries nor

<emphasis>exercise</emphasis>, <emphasis>problem</emphasis>, or <emphasis>project</emphasis>.
These are all typeset as special kind of
sections. Such sections start with a subsection or subsubsection
headline, indicated by 3 or 5 <literal>=</literal> characters, and last up to the
next headline or the end of the file. The headline itself must
consists of the word &quot;Exercise&quot;, &quot;Problem&quot;, or &quot;Project&quot;, followed
by a colon and a title of the exercise, problem, or project.
The next line(s) may contain a label and specification of the
name of result file (if the answer to the exercise is to be handed
it) and a solution file:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">===== Project: Determine the Distance to the Moon =====

__Hint 2.__ Wikipedia is always helpful.</literal_block><paragraph>Doconce will recognize the exercise, problem, or project <emphasis>title</emphasis>,
the <emphasis>label</emphasis>, the <emphasis>result file</emphasis>, the <emphasis>solution file</emphasis> (if any of
these three entities is present), the <emphasis>text</emphasis>, and a sequence of
<emphasis>hints</emphasis>. Tailored formatting of exercises in special output formats
can make use of this. For example, one can image web formats where
the hints are displayed one by one when needed and where the result
file can be uploaded. One can also think of mechanisms for downloading
the solution file if the result file meets certain criteria.
Doconce does not yet generate such functionality in any output format,
but this is an intended future feature to be impelemented.</paragraph><paragraph>Because exercises, problems, and projects are typeset as ordinary
sections (this is the most general approach that will work for many
formats), one must refer to an exercise, problem, or project
by its label, which normally will translate to the section number
(in LaTeX, for instance) or a link to the title of the section.
The <emphasis>title</emphasis> is typeset without any leading &quot;Exercise:&quot;, &quot;Problem:&quot;,
or &quot;Project:&quot; word, so that references like &quot;see Problem ...&quot;
works well in all formats (&quot;...&quot; will be a number in LaTeX and
the problem title in most other formats).</paragraph><paragraph>It is recommended to collect all exercises as subsetions (or subsubsections)

&quot;begin code&quot; <literal>!bc</literal> keyword and an &quot;end code&quot; <literal>!ec</literal> keyword. Both
keywords must be on a single line and <emphasis>start at the beginning of the
line</emphasis>.  Before such a code block there must be a plain sentence
(at least if successful transformation to reST and
ASCII-type formats is desired). For example, a code block cannot come
directly after a section/paragraph heading or a table.</paragraph><paragraph>There may be an argument after the <literal>!bc</literal> tag to specify a
certain environment (for <literal>ptex2tex</literal> or Sphinx) for typesetting
the verbatim code. For instance, <literal>!bc dat</literal> corresponds to
the data file environment and <literal>!bc cod</literal> is typically
used for a code snippet. There are some predefined environments
explained below. If there is
no argument specifying the environment, one assumes some plain
verbatim typesetting (for <literal>ptex2tex</literal> this means the <literal>ccq</literal> environment,
which is defined in the config file <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal>,
while for Sphinx it defaults to the <literal>python</literal> environment).</paragraph><paragraph>Since the config file for <literal>ptex2tex</literal> can define what some environment
maps onto with respect to typesetting, a similar possibility is
supported for Sphinx as well.  The argument after <literal>!bc</literal> is in case of
Sphinx output mapped onto a valid Pygments language for typesetting of
the verbatim block by Pygments. This mapping takes place in an
optional comment to be inserted in the Doconce source file, e.g.:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve"># sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=fortran cppcod=c++ sys=console</literal_block><paragraph>Here, three arguments are defined: <literal>pycod</literal> for Python code,
<literal>cod</literal> also for Python code, <literal>cppcod</literal> for C++ code, and <literal>sys</literal>
for terminal sessions. The same arguments would be defined
in <literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal> for how to typeset the blocks in LaTeX using
various verbatim styles (Pygments can also be used in a LaTeX
context).</paragraph><paragraph>By default, <literal>pro</literal> is used for complete programs in Python, <literal>cod</literal> is
for a code snippet in Python, while <literal>xcod</literal> and <literal>xpro</literal> implies computer
language specific typesetting where <literal>x</literal> can be <literal>f</literal> for Fortran, <literal>c</literal>
for C, <literal>cpp</literal> for C++, <literal>sh</literal> for Unix shells, <literal>pl</literal> for Perl, <literal>m</literal> for
Matlab, <literal>cy</literal> for Cython, and <literal>py</literal> for Python.  The argument <literal>sys</literal>
means by default <literal>console</literal> for Sphinx and <literal>CodeTerminal</literal> (ptex2tex
environent) for LaTeX. Other specifications are <literal>dat</literal> for a data file
or print out, and <literal>ipy</literal> for interactive Python sessions (the latter
does not introduce any environment  in <literal>sphinx</literal> output, as interactive
sessions are automatically recognized and handled).  All these
definitions of the arguments after <literal>!bc</literal> can be redefined in the
<literal>.ptex2tex.cfg</literal> configuration file for ptex2tex/LaTeX and in the
<literal>sphinx code-blocks</literal> comments for Sphinx. Support for other languages

<literal>newcommand_replace.tex</literal> are expanded when Doconce is filtered to

itself).  Newcommands in files with names <literal>newcommands.tex</literal> and
<literal>newcommands_keep.tex</literal> are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
<literal>!bt</literal> and <literal>!et</literal> in <literal>newcommands_keep.tex</literal> to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to

leaving out text, or inserting special text depending on the format.
Two preprocessors are supported: preprocess
(<reference name="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess">http://code.google.com/p/preprocess</reference><target ids="http-code-google-com-p-preprocess" names="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess" refuri="http://code.google.com/p/preprocess"/>) and mako
(<reference name="http://www.makotemplates.org/" refuri="http://www.makotemplates.org/">http://www.makotemplates.org/</reference><target ids="http-www-makotemplates-org" names="http://www.makotemplates.org/" refuri="http://www.makotemplates.org/"/>). The former allows include and if-else
statements much like the well-known preprocessor in C and C++ (but it
does not allow sophisticated macro substitutions). The latter
preprocessor is a very powerful template system.  With Mako you can
automatically generate various type of text and steer the generation
through Python code embedded in the Doconce document. An arbitrary set
of <literal>name=value</literal> command-line arguments (at the end of the command line)
automatically define Mako variables that are substituted in the document.</paragraph><paragraph>Doconce will detect if preprocess or Mako commands are used and run
the relevant preprocessor prior to translating the Doconce source to a
specific format.</paragraph><paragraph>The preprocess and mako programs always have the variable <literal>FORMAT</literal>
defined as the desired output format of Doconce (<literal>html</literal>, <literal>latex</literal>,
<literal>plain</literal>, <literal>rst</literal>, <literal>sphinx</literal>, <literal>epydoc</literal>, <literal>st</literal>).  It is then easy to test on
the value of <literal>FORMAT</literal> and take different actions for different
formats. For example, one may create special LaTeX output for figures,
say with multiple plots within a figure, while other formats may apply
a separate figure for each plot. Below is an example (see the Doconce
source code of this document to understand how preprocess is used to
create the example).</paragraph><comment xml:space="preserve">If PNGFIGS is defined, PNG files are used, otherwise Encapsulated</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">PostScript files are used.</comment><comment xml:space="preserve">Use default Doconce figure handling for all other formats</comment><figure><image uri="figs/wavepacket_0001.png" width="400"/><caption>Wavepacket at time 0.1 s</caption></figure><figure><image uri="figs/wavepacket_0010.png" width="400"/><caption>Wavepacket at time 0.2 s</caption></figure><paragraph>Other user-defined variables for the preprocessor can be set at

However, there must be a master document including all the pieces,
otherwise references to sections and the index will not work properly.
The master document is preferably a file just containing a set of
preprocessor include statements of the form <literal>#include &quot;file.do.txt&quot;</literal>.
The preprocessor will put together all the pieces so that Doconce
sees a long file with the complete text.</paragraph><paragraph>For reST and Sphinx documents it is a point to have
separate <literal>.rst</literal> files and an index file listing the various <literal>.rst</literal>
that build up the document. To generate the various <literal>.rst</literal> files one
should not run Doconce on the individual <literal>.do.txt</literal> files, because then
references and index entries are not treated correctly. Instead,
run Doconce on the master file and invoke the script <literal>doconce split_rst</literal>
to split the long, complete <literal>.rst</literal> into pieces. This process requires
that each <literal>#include &quot;file.do.txt</literal> line in the master file is preceded by a
&quot;marker line&quot; having the syntax <literal>#&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part: file &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</literal>, where
<literal>file</literal> is the filename without extension. The number of greater than
signs is not important, but it has to be a comment line and it has
to contain the keyword <literal>part:</literal>.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is an example. Say the name of the master file is <literal>master.do.txt</literal>.
The following Bash script does the job:
We run:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">doconce format sphinx master
# Split master.rst into parts
# as defined by #&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part: name &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lines
files=`doconce split_rst master.rst`

dir=sphinxm-rootdir

if [ ! -d $dir ]; then
  doconce sphinx_dir dirname=$dir author='me and you' \
          version=1.0 theme=default $files
  sh automake-sphinx.sh
else
  for file in $files; do
    cp $file.rst $dir
  done
  cd $dir
  make html
  cd ..
fi</literal_block><paragraph>The autogenerated <literal>automake-sphinx.sh</literal> file (by <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal>)
is compatible with a master <literal>.rst</literal> file split into pieces as long as
the complete set of pieces in correct order is given to <literal>doconce sphinx_dir</literal>.
This set is the output of <literal>doconce split_rst</literal>, which we catch in a
variable <literal>files</literal> above.</paragraph></section><section ids="missing-features" names="missing\ features"><title>Missing Features</title><paragraph>Doconce does not aim to support sophisticated typesetting, simply because
sophisticated typesetting usually depend quite strongly on the particular
output format chosen. When a particular feature needed is not supported
by Doconce, it is recommended to hardcode that feature for a particular
format and use the if-else construction of the preprocessor. For example,
if a sophisticated table is desired in LaTeX output, test on the
<literal>FORMAT</literal> variable (<literal>#if FORMAT == &quot;latex&quot;</literal>) in the Doconce code and
insert the table in LaTeX format. The <literal>else</literal> or <literal>elif</literal> branches may
have the table in other formats or a simplified version in the Doconce
table format. Similarly, if certain adjustments are needed, like
pagebreaks in LaTeX, hardcode that in the Doconce format (and recall
that this is really LaTeX dependent - pagebreaks are not
relevant HTML formats).</paragraph><paragraph>Instead of inserting special code in the Doconce document, one can
alternatively script editing of the output from Doconce. That is,
we develop a Python or Bash script that runs the translation of
a Doconce document to a ready docoment in another format. Inside this
script, we may edit and fine-tune the output from Doconce.</paragraph><paragraph>As an example, say you want a table of contents in the LaTeX output
(Doconce does not support table of contents). By inserting a
recognizable comment in the Doconce source, say:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve"># table of contents</literal_block><paragraph>we can use this comment to edit the LaTeX file. First, we run
Doconce <literal>doconce format latex mydoc</literal> to produce <literal>mydoc.p.tex</literal>. Then
we use the <literal>doconce replace</literal> and <literal>doconce subst</literal> commands to
replace the comment by the comment plus the table of contents command,
or just the latter:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce replace '% table of contents'
          '\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex</literal_block><paragraph>The <literal>doconce replace from_text to_text filename</literal> command performs a
character-by-character replacement (using the <literal>replace</literal> method in
string objects in Python). If we want to preserve the comment and add
a new line with <literal>\tableofcontents</literal>, we should use <literal>doconce subst</literal>,
which applies regular expressions for substitutions and thereby
understands the newline character:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">Terminal&gt; doconce subst '% table of contents' \
          '% table of contents\n\\tableofcontents' mydoc.p.tex</literal_block><paragraph>Note the double backshlash in front of the <literal>t</literal> character: without it we
would get a tab and no backslash.
The <literal>doconce subst</literal> is a powerful way to automatically edit the output
from Doconce and fine-tune a LaTeX document. Use of comment lines to
identify portions of the file to be edited is a smart idea.
Alternatively, the relevant LaTeX constructions can be inserted directly
in the Doconce file using if-else preprocessor directives.</paragraph></section><section ids="header-and-footer" names="header\ and\ footer"><title>Header and Footer</title><paragraph>Some formats use a header and footer in the document. LaTeX and
HTML are two examples of such formats. When the document is to be
included in another document (which is often the case with
Doconce-based documents), the header and footer are not wanted, while
these are needed (at least in a LaTeX context) if the document is
stand-alone. We have introduce the convention that if <literal>TITLE:</literal> or
<literal>#TITLE:</literal> is found at the beginning of the line (i.e., the document
has, or has an intention have, a title), the header and footer
are included, otherwise not.</paragraph></section><section ids="emacs-doconce-formatter" names="emacs\ doconce\ formatter"><title>Emacs Doconce Formatter</title><paragraph>The file <literal>misc/.doconce-mode.el</literal> in the Doconce source distribution

software is incomplete, and many special cases of syntax are not yet
discovered to give problems. Such special cases are also seldom easy to
fix, so one important way of &quot;debugging&quot; Doconce is simply to change
the formatting so that Doconce treats it properly. Doconce is very much
based on regular expressions, which are known to be non-trivial to
debug years after they are created. The main developer of Doconce has
hardly any time to work on debugging the code, but the software works
well for his diverse applications of it.</paragraph></section><section ids="general-problems" names="general\ problems"><title>General Problems</title><section ids="something-goes-wrong-in-the-preprocessing-step" names="something\ goes\ wrong\ in\ the\ preprocessing\ step"><title>Something goes wrong in the preprocessing step</title><paragraph>Doconce automatically removes the file <literal>__tmp.do.txt</literal>, which is the

If this LaTeX code is not sufficient for your needs, there are
two ways out of it:</paragraph><enumerated_list enumtype="arabic" prefix="" suffix="."><list_item><paragraph>Make a little Bash script that performs a series of
<literal>doconce subst</literal> (regular expressions) or <literal>doconce replace</literal> (regular text)
substitutions to change the text automatically (you probably have to
repeat these edits so automating them is a good idea).</paragraph></list_item><list_item><paragraph>Place the title, author(s), and date of the Doconce file in a separate
file and use the preprocessor to include the rest. The rest is then
one or more Doconce files without title, author(s), and date. This
means that the <literal>doconce format latex</literal> command does not generate
the LaTeX intro (preamble) and outro, just the core text, for these
files.
Make a new file by hand with the appropriate LaTeX intro and outro
text and include the various text pieces in this file.
To make the LaTeX document, you compile all Doconce files
into LaTeX code, except the &quot;top&quot; Doconce file that includes the
others. That file is not used for LaTeX output, but
replaced by the hand-written LaTeX &quot;top&quot; file.</paragraph></list_item></enumerated_list></section></section><section ids="problems-with-gwiki-output" names="problems\ with\ gwiki\ output"><title>Problems with gwiki Output</title><section ids="strange-nested-lists-in-gwiki" names="strange\ nested\ lists\ in\ gwiki"><title>Strange nested lists in gwiki</title><paragraph>Doconce cannot handle nested lists correctly in the gwiki format.

is seldom to be looked at - it is the Doconce source that one edits
further.</paragraph></section></section><section ids="debugging" names="debugging"><title>Debugging</title><paragraph>Given a problem, extract a small portion of text surrounding the
problematic area and debug that small piece of text. Doconce does a
series of transformations of the text. The effect of each of these
transformation steps are dumped to a logfile, named
<literal>_doconce_debugging.log</literal>, if the to <literal>doconce format</literal> after the filename
is <literal>debug</literal>. The logfile is inteded for the developers of Doconce, but
may still give some idea of what is wrong.  The section &quot;Basic Parsing
Ideas&quot; explains how the Doconce text is transformed into a specific
format, and you need to know these steps to make use of the logfile.</paragraph></section></section><section ids="basic-parsing-ideas" names="basic\ parsing\ ideas"><title>Basic Parsing Ideas</title><comment xml:space="preserve">avoid list here since we have code in between (never a good idea)</comment><paragraph>The (parts of) files with computer code to be directly included in

to ensure that no formatting rules are not applied to these blocks.</paragraph><paragraph>The text is examined line by line for typesetting of lists, as well as
handling of blank lines and comment lines.
List parsing needs some awareness of the context.
Each line is interpreted by a regular expression:</paragraph><literal_block xml:space="preserve">(?P&lt;indent&gt; *(?P&lt;listtype&gt;[*o-] )? *)(?P&lt;keyword&gt;[^:]+?:)?(?P&lt;text&gt;.*)\s?</literal_block><paragraph>That is, a possible indent (which we measure), an optional list
item identifier, optional space, optional words ended by colon,
and optional text. All lines are of this form. However, some
ordinary (non-list) lines may contain a colon, and then the keyword
and text group must be added to get the line contents. Otherwise,
the text group will be the line.</paragraph><paragraph>When lists are typeset, the text is examined for sections, paragraphs,
title, author, date, plus all the inline tags for emphasized, boldface,
and verbatim text. Plain subsitutions based on regular expressions
are used for this purpose.</paragraph><paragraph>The final step is to insert the code and TeX blocks again (these should
be untouched and are therefore left out of the previous parsing).</paragraph><paragraph>It is important to keep the Doconce format and parsing simple.  When a
new format is needed and this format is not obtained by a simple edit
of the definition of existing formats, it might be better to convert
the document to reST and then to XML, parse the XML and
write out in the new format.  When the Doconce format is not
sufficient to getting the layout you want, it is suggested to filter
the document to another, more complex format, say reST or
LaTeX, and work further on the document in this format.</paragraph><section ids="a-glimpse-of-how-to-write-a-new-translator" names="a\ glimpse\ of\ how\ to\ write\ a\ new\ translator"><title>A Glimpse of How to Write a New Translator</title><paragraph>This is the HTML-specific part of the
