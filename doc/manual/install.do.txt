======= Installation of Doconce and its Dependencies =======

Below, we explain the manual installation of all software that may be
needed when working with Doconce documents.
The impatient way to install what is needed is to run the
"doconce_install_all.sh": "doconce_install_all.sh" script.

===== Doconce =====

Doconce itself is pure Python code hosted at URL:
"http://code.google.com/p/doconce".  Its installation from the
Mercurial (`hg`) source follows the standard procedure:
!bc sys
# Doconce
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/doconce/ doconce
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
!ec
Since Doconce is frequently updated, it is recommended to use the
above procedure and whenever a problem occurs, make sure to
update to the most recent version:
!bc sys
cd doconce
hg pull
hg update
sudo python setup.py install
!ec

# #ifdef OUTDATED
Debian GNU/Linux users can also run
!bc sys
sudo apt-get install doconce
!ec
This installs the latest release and not the most updated and bugfixed
version.
On Ubuntu one needs to run
!bc sys
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scitools/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install doconce
!ec
# #endif

===== Dependencies =====

Producing HTML documents, plain text, pandoc-extended Markdown,
and wikis can be done without installing any other
software. However, if you want other formats as output
(LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText) and assisting utilities such
as preprocesors, spellcheck, file differences, bibliographies,
and so on, the software below must be installed.

# Make a debpkg_doconce.txt file with everything that is needed on Debian

=== Preprocessors ===

If you make use of the "Preprocess": "http://code.google.com/p/preprocess"
preprocessor, this program must be installed:

!bc sys
svn checkout http://preprocess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ preprocess
cd preprocess
cd doconce
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
!ec

A much more advanced alternative to Preprocess is
"Mako": "http://www.makotemplates.org". Its installation is most
conveniently done by `pip`,

!bc sys
pip install Mako
!ec
This command requires `pip` to be installed. On Debian Linux systems,
such as Ubuntu, the installation is simply done by

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install python-pip
!ec
Alternatively, one can install from the `pip` "source code": "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip".

Mako can also be installed directly from
"source": "http://www.makotemplates.org/download.html": download the
tarball, pack it out, go to the directory and run
the usual `sudo python setup.py install`.

=== Image file handling ===

Different output formats require different formats of image files.
For example, PostScript or Encapuslated PostScript is required for `latex`
output, while HTML needs JPEG, GIF, or PNG formats.
Doconce calls up programs from the ImageMagick suite for converting
image files to a proper format if needed. The "ImageMagick suite": "http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php" can be installed on all major platforms.
On Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems one can simply write

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
!ec

The convenience program `doconce combine_images`, for combining several
images into one, will use `montage` and `convert` from ImageMagick and
the `pdftk`, `pdfnup`, and `pdfcrop` programs from the `texlive-extra-utils`
Debian package. The latter gets installed by

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install texlive-extra-utils
!ec

=== Spellcheck ===

The utility `doconce spellcheck` applies the `ispell` program for
spellcheck. On Debian (including Ubuntu) it is installed by

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install ispell
!ec


=== Bibliography ===

The Python package "Publish":
"https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish" is needed if you use a bibliography
in your document. On the website, click on *Clone*, copy the
command and run it:

!bc sys
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/logg/publish
!ec
Thereafter go to the `publish` directory and run the `setup.py` script
for installing Publish:

!bc sys
cd publish
sudo python setup.py
!ec


=== Ptex2tex for LaTeX Output ===

To make LaTeX documents with very flexible choice of typesetting of
verbatim code blocks you need "ptex2tex": "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex",
which is installed by

!bc sys
svn checkout http://ptex2tex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ptex2tex
cd ptex2tex
sudo python setup.py install
!ec
It may happen that you need additional style files, you can run
a script, `cp2texmf.sh`:

!bc sys
cd latex
sh cp2texmf.sh  # copy stylefiles to ~/texmf directory
cd ../..
!ec
This script copies some special stylefiles that
that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of. Some more standard stylefiles
are also needed. These are installed by

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra
!ec
on Debian Linux (including Ubuntu) systems. TeXShop on Mac comes with
the necessary stylefiles (if not, they can be found by googling and installed
manually in the `~/texmf/tex/latex/misc` directory).

Note that the `doconce ptex2tex` command, which needs no installation
beyond Doconce itself, can be used as a simpler alternative to the `ptex2tex`
program.

The *minted* LaTeX style is offered by `ptex2tex` and `doconce ptext2tex`
and popular among many
users. This style requires the package "Pygments": "http://pygments.org"
to be installed. On Debian Linux,
!bc sys
sudo apt-get install python-pygments
!ec
Alternatively, the package can be installed manually:
!bc sys
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main pygments
cd pygments
sudo python setup.py install
!ec
One can also do the simple

!bc sys
pip install sphinx
!ec
which also installs pygments.

If you use the minted style together with `ptex2tex`, you have to
enable it by the `-DMINTED` command-line argument to `ptex2tex`.
This is not necessary if you run the alternative `doconce ptex2tex` program.

All use of the minted style requires the `-shell-escape` command-line
argument when running LaTeX, i.e., `latex -shell-escape` or `pdflatex
-shell-escape`.

Inline comments apply the `todonotes` LaTeX package if the `ptex2tex`
or `doconce ptex2tex` command is run with `-DTODONOTES`.  The
`todonotes` package requires several other packages: `xcolor`,
`ifthen`, `xkeyval`, `tikz`, `calc`, `graphicx`, and `setspace`. The
relevant Debian package for installing all this is
`texlive-latex-extra`.

=== LaTeX packages ===

Many LaTeX packages are potentially needed (depending on various
preprocessor variables given to `ptex2tex` or `doconce ptex2tex`.  The
standard packages always included are `relsize`, `epsfig`, `makeidx`,
`setspace`, `color`, `amsmath`, `amsfonts`, `xcolor`, `bm`,
`microtype`, `titlesec`, and `hyperref`.  The `ptex2tex` package (from
"ptex2tex": "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex") is also included, but
removed again if `doconce ptex2tex` is run instead of the `ptex2tex`
program, meaning that if you do not use `ptex2tex`, you do not need
`ptex2tex.sty`. Optional packages that might be included are `minted`,
`fontspec`, `xunicode`, `inputenc`, `helvet`, `mathpazo`, `wrapfig`,
`calc`, `ifthen`, `xkeyval`, `tikz`, `graphicx`, `setspace`, `shadow`,
`disable`, `todonotes`, `lineno`, `xr`, `movie15`, `a4paper`, and
`a6paper`.

Relevant Debian packages that gives you all of these LaTeX packages are

!bc
texlive-latex-base
texlive-latex-recommended
texlive-latex-extra
texlive-math-extra
texlive-bibtex-extra
texlive-xetex
texlive-humanities
texlive-pictures
!ec

If you want to use the *anslistings* code environment with `ptex2tex`
(`.ptex2tex.cfg` styles `Python_ANS`, `Python_ANSt`, `Cpp_ANS`, etc.) or
`doconce ptex2tex` (`envir=ans` or `envir=ans:nt`), you need the
`anslistings.sty` file. It can be obtained from
the "ptex2tex source": "https://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex/source/browse/trunk/latex/styles/with_license/anslistings.sty". It should get installed
by the `cp2texmf.sh` script executed above.


=== reStructuredText (reST) Output ===

The `rst` output from Doconce allows further transformation to LaTeX,
HTML, XML, OpenOffice, and so on, through the "docutils":
"http://docutils.sourceforge.net" package.  The installation of the
most recent version can be done by

!bc sys
svn checkout \
  http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils
cd docutils
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
!ec
The command

!bc sys
pip install sphinx
!ec
installs Docutils along with Sphinx and Pygments.

To use the OpenOffice suite you will typically on Debian systems install
!bc sys
sudo apt-get install unovonv libreoffice libreoffice-dmaths
!ec

There is a possibility to create PDF files from reST documents
using ReportLab instead of LaTeX. The enabling software is
"rst2pdf": "http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf". Either download the tarball
or clone the svn repository, go to the `rst2pdf` directory and
run the usual `sudo python setup.py install`.

=== Sphinx Output ===

Output to `sphinx` requires of course the
"Sphinx software": "http://sphinx.pocoo.org",
installed by

!bc sys
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx
cd sphinx
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
!ec
An alternative is

!bc sys
pip install sphinx
!ec

Doconce comes with many Sphinx themes that are not part of the
standard Sphinx source distribution. Some of these themes require
additional Python/Sphinx modules to be installed:

 * cloud and redcloud: URL: "https://bitbucket.org/ecollins/cloud_sptheme"
 * bootstrap: URL: "https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme"
 * solarized: URL: "https://bitbucket.org/miiton/sphinxjp.themes.solarized"
 * impressjs: URL: "https://github.com/shkumagai/sphinxjp.themes.impressjs"

These must be downloaded or cloned, and `setup.py` must be run as shown
above.

=== Markdown and Pandoc Output ===

The Doconce format `pandoc` outputs the document in the Pandoc
extended Markdown format, which via the `pandoc` program can be
translated to a range of other formats. Installation of "Pandoc":
"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/", written in Haskell, is most
easily done by

!bc sys
sudo apt-get install pandoc
!ec
on Debian (Ubuntu) systems.

=== Epydoc Output ===

When the output format is `epydoc` one needs that program too, installed
by
!bc sys
svn co https://epydoc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/epydoc/trunk/epydoc epydoc
cd epydoc
sudo make install
cd ..
!ec

__Remark.__ Several of the packages above installed from source code
are also available in Debian-based system through the
`apt-get install` command. However, we recommend installation directly
from the version control system repository as there might be important
updates and bug fixes. For `svn` directories, go to the directory,
run `svn update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`. For
Mercurial (`hg`) directories, go to the directory, run
`hg pull; hg update`, and then `sudo python setup.py install`.

=== The `doconce diff` command ===

The `doconce diff file1 file prog` command for illustrating differences between
two files `file1` and `file2` using the program `prog` requires `prog`
to be installed. By default, `prog` is `difflib` which comes with Python
and is always present if you have Doconce installed. Another choice, `diff`,
should be available on all Unix/Linux systems. Other choices, their
URL, and their `sudo apt-get install` command on Debian (Ubuntu) systems
appear in the table below.
