Here is some simple mathematics:

!bt
\begin{align}
f(x) &= \frac{1}{1 + x^2},
label{eq:f}\\
f'(x) & =-\frac{2x}{(1+x^2)^2}
label{eq:df}
\end{align}
!et
which can be implemented in a computer code:

@@@CODE Runges_func.py

A plot of the function $f(x)$
# #if FORMAT in ("html", "latex", "pdflatex", "sphinx")
defined in (ref{eq:f})
# #endif
appears below.

Here is the derivative $f'(x)$ (with figure caption and label, which enables
referring to the figure later):
