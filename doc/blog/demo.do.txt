# This is a demo of a blog shown on doconce.blogspot.com

Here is some simple mathematics:

!bt
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2},\]
!et

# Always insert a blank line after math blocks (otherwise
# the math block is not correctly rendered on blogspot.com)
which can be implemented in a computer code:

!bc pycod
def f(x):
    """Runge's function."""
    return 1 + x**2
!ec

A plot of the function appears below.
