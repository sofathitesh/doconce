TITLE: Doconce: Document Once, Include Anywhere
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen at Simula Research Laboratory and University of Oslo
DATE: today


 * When writing a note, report, manual, etc., do you find it difficult
   to choose the typesetting format? That is, to choose between plain
   (email-like) text, Wiki, Word/OpenOffice, LaTeX, HTML, Markdown,
   reStructuredText, Sphinx, XML, etc.  Would it be convenient to
   start with some very simple text-like format that easily converts
   to the formats listed above, and then at some later stage eventually go
   with a particular format?

 * Do you find it problematic that you have the same information
   scattered around in different documents in different typesetting
   formats? Would it be a good idea to write things once, in one format,
   stored in one place, and include it anywhere?

If any of these questions are of interest, you should keep on reading.


======= The Doconce Concept  =======

Doconce is two things:

  o Doconce is a very simple and minimally tagged markup language that
    looks like ordinary ASCII text (much like what you would use in an
    email), but the text can be transformed to numerous other formats,
    including HTML, Wiki, LaTeX, PDF, reStructuredText (reST), Sphinx,
    Epytext, and also plain text (where non-obvious formatting/tags are
    removed for clear reading in, e.g., emails). From reStructuredText
    you can go to XML, HTML, LaTeX, PDF, OpenOffice, and from the
    latter to RTF and MS Word.
    (An experimental translator to Pandoc is under development, and from
    Pandoc one can generate Markdown, reST, LaTeX, HTML, PDF, DocBook XML,
    OpenOffice, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki, RTF, Groff, and other formats.)
    

  o Doconce is a working strategy for never duplicating information.
    Text is written in a single place and then transformed to
    a number of different destinations of diverse type (software
    source code, manuals, tutorials, books, wikis, memos, emails, etc.).
    The Doconce markup language support this working strategy.
    The slogan is: "Write once, include anywhere".
    


Here are some Doconce features:

  * Doconce markup does include tags, so the format is more tagged than 
    Markdown and Pandoc, but less than reST, and very much less than 
    LaTeX and HTML. 
  * Doconce can be converted to plain *untagged* text, 
    often desirable for computer programs and email.
  * Doconce has good support for copying in parts of computer code,
    say in examples, directly from the source code files.
  * Doconce has full support for LaTeX math, and integrates very well
    with big LaTeX projects (books).
  * Doconce is almost self-explanatory and is a handy starting point
    for generating documents in more complicated markup languages, such
    as Google Wiki, LaTeX, and Sphinx. A primary application of Doconce
    is just to make the initial versions of a Sphinx or Wiki document.
  * Contrary to the similar Pandoc translator, Doconce integrates with
    Sphinx and Google Wiki. However, if these formats are not of interest,
    Pandoc is obviously a superior tool.

Doconce was particularly written for the following sample applications:

  * Large books written in LaTeX, but where many pieces (computer demos,
    projects, examples) can be written in Doconce to appear in other
    contexts in other formats, including plain HTML, Sphinx, or MS Word.

  * Software documentation, primarily Python doc strings, which one wants
    to appear as plain untagged text for viewing in Pydoc, as reStructuredText
    for use with Sphinx, as wiki text when publishing the software at
    web sites, and as LaTeX integrated in, e.g., a thesis.

  * Quick memos, which start as plain text in email, then some small
    amount of Doconce tagging is added, before the memos can appear as
    MS Word documents or in wikis.

History: Doconce was developed in 2006 at a time when most popular
markup languages used quite some tagging.  Later, almost untagged
markup languages like Markdown and Pandoc became popular. Doconce is
not a replacement of Pandoc, which is a considerably more
sophisticated project. Moreover, Doconce was developed mainly to
fulfill the needs for a flexible source code base for books with much
mathematics and computer code.

Disclaimer: Doconce is a simple tool, largely based on interpreting
and handling text through regular expressions. The possibility for
tweaking the layout is obviously limited since the text can go to
all sorts of sophisticated markup languages. Moreover, because of
limitations of regular expressions, some formatting may face problems 
when transformed to other formats. 



======= What Does Doconce Look Like? =======

Doconce text looks like ordinary text, but there are some almost invisible
text constructions that allow you to control the formating. For example,

  * bullet lists arise from lines starting with an asterisk,

  * *emphasized words* are surrounded by asterisks, 

  * _words in boldface_ are surrounded by underscores, 

  * words from computer code are enclosed in back quotes and 
    then typeset verbatim,

  * blocks of computer code can easily be included, also from source files,

  * blocks of LaTeX mathematics can easily be included,
 
  * there is support for both LaTeX and text-like inline mathematics,

  * figures with captions, URLs with links, labels and references
    are supported,

  * comments can be inserted throughout the text,

  * with a simple preprocessor, which is integrated, one can include
    other documents (files) and large portions of text can be defined
    in or out of the text,

  * with the Mako preprocessor one can even embed Python
    code and use this to steer generation of Doconce text.

Here is an example of some simple text written in the Doconce format:
!bc
===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have automatically numbered items instead of bullets,

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Chapter ref{my:first:sec}. 

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Chapter ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|

# lines beginning with # are comment lines
!ec
The Doconce text above results in the following little document:

===== A Subsection with Sample Text =====
label{my:first:sec}

Ordinary text looks like ordinary text, and the tags used for
_boldface_ words, *emphasized* words, and `computer` words look
natural in plain text.  Lists are typeset as you would do in an email,

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Lists can also have numbered items instead of bullets, just use an `o`
(for ordered) instead of the asterisk:

  o item 1
  o item 2
  o item 3

URLs with a link word are possible, as in "hpl":"http://folk.uio.no/hpl".
If the word is URL, the URL itself becomes the link name,
as in "URL":"tutorial.do.txt".

References to sections may use logical names as labels (e.g., a
"label" command right after the section title), as in the reference to
Chapter ref{my:first:sec}. 

Doconce also allows inline comments such as [hpl: here I will make
some remarks to the text] for allowing authors to make notes. Inline
comments can be removed from the output by a command-line argument
(see Chapter ref{doconce2formats} for an example).

Tables are also supperted, e.g.,

  |--------------------------------|
  |time  | velocity | acceleration |
  |--------------------------------|
  | 0.0  | 1.4186   | -5.01        |
  | 2.0  | 1.376512 | 11.919       |
  | 4.0  | 1.1E+1   | 14.717624    |
  |--------------------------------|


===== Mathematics and Computer Code =====

Inline mathematics, such as $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$,
allows the formula to be specified both as LaTeX and as plain text.
This results in a professional LaTeX typesetting, but in other formats
the text version normally looks better than raw LaTeX mathematics with
backslashes. An inline formula like $\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$ is
typeset as
!bc
$\nu = \sin(x)$|$v = sin(x)$
!ec
The pipe symbol acts as a delimiter between LaTeX code and the plain text
version of the formula.

Blocks of mathematics are better typeset with raw LaTeX, inside
`!bt` and `!et` (begin tex / end tex) instructions. 
The result looks like this:
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial u\over\partial t} &=& \nabla^2 u + f, label{myeq1}\\
{\partial v\over\partial t} &=& \nabla\cdot(q(u)\nabla v) + g
\end{eqnarray}
!et
Of course, such blocks only looks nice in LaTeX. The raw
LaTeX syntax appears in all other formats (but can still be useful
for those who can read LaTeX syntax).

You can have blocks of computer code, starting and ending with
`!bc` and `!ec` instructions, respectively. Such blocks look like
!bc cod
from math import sin, pi
def myfunc(x):
    return sin(pi*x)

import integrate
I = integrate.trapezoidal(myfunc, 0, pi, 100)
!ec
It is possible to add a specification of a (ptex2tex-style)
environment for typesetting the verbatim code block, e.g., `!bc xxx`
where `xxx` is an identifier like `pycod` for code snippet in Python,
`sys` for terminal session, etc. When Doconce is filtered to LaTeX,
these identifiers are used as in ptex2tex and defined in a
configuration file `.ptext2tex.cfg`, while when filtering
to Sphinx, one can have a comment line in the Doconce file for
mapping the identifiers to legal language names for Sphinx (which equals
the legal language names for Pygments):
!bc
# sphinx code-blocks: pycod=python cod=py cppcod=c++ sys=console
!ec
By default, `pro` and `cod` are `python`, `sys` is `console`,
while `xpro` and `xcod` are computer language specific for `x`
in `f` (Fortran), `c` (C), `cpp` (C++), and `py` (Python).
# `rb` (Ruby), `pl` (Perl), and `sh` (Unix shell).

# (Any sphinx code-block comment, whether inside verbatim code
# blocks or outside, yields a mapping between bc arguments
# and computer languages. In case of muliple definitions, the
# first one is used.)

One can also copy computer code directly from files, either the
complete file or specified parts.  Computer code is then never
duplicated in the documentation (important for the principle of
avoiding copying information!). A complete file is typeset 
with `!bc pro`, while a part of a file is copied into a `!bc cod`
environment. What `pro` and `cod` mean is then defined through
a `.ptex2tex.cfg` file for LaTeX and a `sphinx code-blocks`
comment for Sphinx.

Another document can be included by writing `#include "mynote.do.txt"`
on a line starting with (another) hash sign.  Doconce documents have
extension `do.txt`. The `do` part stands for doconce, while the
trailing `.txt` denotes a text document so that editors gives you the
right writing enviroment for plain text.


===== Macros (Newcommands), Cross-References, Index, and Bibliography =====
label{newcommands}

Doconce supports a type of macros via a LaTeX-style *newcommand*
construction.  The newcommands defined in a file with name
`newcommand_replace.tex` are expanded when Doconce is filtered to
other formats, except for LaTeX (since LaTeX performs the expansion
itself).  Newcommands in files with names `newcommands.tex` and
`newcommands_keep.tex` are kept unaltered when Doconce text is
filtered to other formats, except for the Sphinx format. Since Sphinx
understands LaTeX math, but not newcommands if the Sphinx output is
HTML, it makes most sense to expand all newcommands.  Normally, a user
will put all newcommands that appear in math blocks surrounded by
`!bt` and `!et` in `newcommands_keep.tex` to keep them unchanged, at
least if they contribute to make the raw LaTeX math text easier to
read in the formats that cannot render LaTeX.  Newcommands used
elsewhere throughout the text will usually be placed in
`newcommands_replace.tex` and expanded by Doconce.  The definitions of
newcommands in the `newcommands*.tex` files *must* appear on a single
line (multi-line newcommands are too hard to parse with regular
expressions).

Recent versions of Doconce also offer cross referencing, typically one
can define labels below (sub)sections, in figure captions, or in
equations, and then refer to these later. Entries in an index can be
defined and result in an index at the end for the LaTeX and Sphinx
formats. Citations to literature, with an accompanying bibliography in
a file, are also supported. The syntax of labels, references,
citations, and the bibliography closely resembles that of LaTeX,
making it easy for Doconce documents to be integrated in LaTeX
projects (manuals, books). For further details on functionality and
syntax we refer to the `docs/manual/manual.do.txt` file (see the
https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/trunk/docs/demos/manual/index.html<demo
page> for various formats of this document).


# Example on including another Doconce file (using preprocess):

# #include "_doconce2anything.do.txt"


===== Demos =====

The current text is generated from a Doconce format stored in the file
!bc
docs/tutorial/tutorial.do.txt
!ec
The file `make.sh` in the `tutorial` directory of the
Doconce source code contains a demo of how to produce a variety of
formats.  The source of this tutorial, `tutorial.do.txt` is the
starting point.  Running `make.sh` and studying the various generated
files and comparing them with the original `tutorial.do.txt` file,
gives a quick introduction to how Doconce is used in a real case.
https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/trunk/docs/demos/tutorial/index.html<Here> 
is a sample of how this tutorial looks in different formats.

There is another demo in the `docs/manual` directory which
translates the more comprehensive documentation, `manual.do.txt`, to
various formats. The `make.sh` script runs a set of translations.

===== Dependencies =====

If you make use of preprocessor directives in the Doconce source,
either "Preprocess": "http://code.google.com/p/preprocess" or "Mako":
"http://www.makotemplates.org" must be installed.  To make LaTeX
documents (without going through the reStructuredText format) you also
need "ptex2tex": "http://code.google.com/p/ptex2tex" and some style
files that `ptex2tex` potentially makes use of.  Going from
reStructuredText to formats such as XML, OpenOffice, HTML, and LaTeX
requires "docutils": "http://docutils.sourceforge.net".  Making Sphinx
documents requires of course "Sphinx": "http://sphinx.pocoo.org".
All of the mentioned potential dependencies are pure Python packages
which are easily installed.
If translation to "Pandoc": "http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/" is desired, 
the Pandoc Haskell program must of course be installed.
