## Headings have 5 = for h3/subsection and 7 = for h1/section
======= Goal =======

The primary goal of this demo talk is to demonstrate how to write
talks with "doconce": "http://code.google.com/p/doconce"
and get them rendered in numerous HTML formats.
# #if FORMAT == "html"
This version
utilizes ${SLIDE_TYPE} slides with the theme ${SLIDE_THEME}.
# #endif

## Demonstrate use of Mako variables set on the command line
## (see last sentence too). We use Preprocess (run before Mako)
## to leave out the Mako test on SLIDE_THEME and SLIDE_TYPE.
## In that way, we do not need to specify these variables on
## the command line when compiling for LaTeX or other formats
## (e.g. for handouts).

# #if FORMAT == "html"
Speaker notes show up by
% if SLIDE_TYPE == 'reveal':
pressing "s".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'deck':
pressing "n".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'csss':
pressing "Ctrl-P".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'html5slides':
pressing "p".
% elif SLIDE_TYPE == 'csss':
using the "onstage.html": "https://doconce.googlecode.com/hg/bundled/dzslides/shells/onstage.html" embedding page.

## Add speaker notes

!bnotes
The talk investigates the accuracy of three finite difference
schemes for the ordinary differential equation $u'=-au$ with the
aid of numerical experiments. Numerical artifacts are in particular
demonstrated.

## New slide is indicated by !split at the beginning of a line:

======= Mathematical problem =======

## Use !bslidecell XY and !eslidecell as begin and end for
## defining a cell XY in a table layout of the slide.
## X=0,1,..., Y=0,1,... XY=00 is the upper left cell.
## Here we define cell 00 and 01 (bullet list to the left
## and figure to the right).

!bslidecell 00

## latex blocks are surrounded by !bt and !et

!bt
\begin{align}
u'(t) &= -au(t),
label{ode}\\
u(0)  &= I,
label{initial:value}
\end{align}
!et

 * $t\in (0,T]$
 * $a$, $I$, and $T$ are prescribed parameters
 * $u(t)$ is the unknown function

!eslidecell

## Figures can have a width parameter specifying the pixel
## width in HTML. A caption can be added (after [...]).

======= Numerical solution method =======

## !bpop and !epop surround elements that are to pop up
## as we progress in the slide show.
## They will often not work if there is code inside.

!bpop
 * Mesh in time: $0= t_0< t_1 \cdots < t_N=T$
 * Assume constant $\Delta t = t_{n}-t_{n-1}$
 * $u^n$: numerical approx to the exact solution at $t_n$
!epop

!bpop
Numerical scheme:
!bt
   \[
   u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
   \quad n=0,1,\ldots,N-1
   \]
!et
!epop

## Next: embed YouTube video

# #if FORMAT == "html"

===== Forward Euler explained =====

% if SLIDE_TYPE == 'reveal':
Embedding YouTube videos does not work with reveal.js slides.
Here is the "link": "http://youtu.be/PtJrPEIHNJw".

# #endif

!split
## Next: exemplify copying code directly from file (start
## with the line matching "def solver" and ending with
## "def verify_three", but not including this last line).

======= Implementation =======

The numerical method is implemented in a Python function:

@@@CODE src/dc_mod.py  fromto: def solver@def verify_three

!split
===== The Crank-Nicolson method =====

## Figure filenames do not need extension - the right version is picked

!split
===== The artifacts can be explained by some theory =====

!bpop
Exact solution of the scheme:

!bt
\[ u^n = A^n,\quad A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}\thinspace .\]
!et
!epop

!bpop
 * Stability: $|A| < 1$
 * No oscillations: $A>0$
 * Always for Backward Euler ($\theta=1$)
 * $\Delta t < 1/a$ for Forward Euler ($\theta=0$)
 * $\Delta t < 2/a$ for Crank-Nicolson ($\theta=1/2$)
