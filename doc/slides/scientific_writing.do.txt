======= Scope =======

!bpop

  * *scientific writing* = lecture notes, slides, reports, thesis, books,  ...
  * (Journal papers typeset by journals are out of scope)
  * Scope: documents with much *math* and *computer code*
  * Key question: What tools should I use for writing?
  * Default answer: LaTeX
  * Alternative: MS Word w/math
  * Recent popular alternative tools: Sphinx, Markdown, IPython notebook

!epop

!split
======= Scientific writing needs to address many new media =======

!bpop
 * Old days (1985-2005): mostly black-and-white documents aimed at printing
 * Now:
   o Black-and-white books
   o Colorful books and PDFs
   o PDFs with hyperlinks
   o HTML web pages (plain or fancy design)
   o Wikis
   o epub
 * LaTeX does not support all of this
 * We need to write for multiple formats!
!epop

!split

======= Popular tools anno 2012 =======

 * _LaTeX_: de facto standard in math-instensive sciences
 * _pdfLaTeX_: takes over (figures in png, pdf)
 * _Word_: popular, but limited math support and not so good-looking
   math fonts
 * _HTML with MathJax_: "full" LaTeX math in HTML
 * _Sphinx_, based on reStructuredText (HTML, LaTeX):
   limited LaTeX math support, great support for web design
 * _reStructuredText_: no math support, transforms to
   lots of formats (LaTeX, HTML, XML, Word, OpenOffice, ...)
 * _Markdown_: email-style untagged formatting,
   limited LaTeX math support, transforms to
   lots of formats (LaTeX, HTML, XML, Word, OpenOffice, ...)
 * _MediaWiki_: "full" LaTeX math support (Wikipedia)
 * Other _wiki_ formats: no math support, great for collaborative editing
 * _Epydoc_: fror Python code documentation
 * _IPython notebooks_: combines Python code, interactivity and Markdown
   writing
 * _Plain text for email_ (no tagging)

======= LaTeX is very rich; other tools support only some elements =======

 * LaTeX inline math: LaTeX, MathJax, Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki
 * LaTeX equation math:
    * LaTeX: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align` +
      `eqnarray`, `split`, `alignat`, ...
    * MathJax: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * MediaWiki: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`, `align`
    * Sphinx: `equation*`, `equation`, `align*`
    * Markdown: `equation*`, `equation`

!split
======= LaTeX is very rich; other tools support only some elements =======

!bpop
 * Figures: all
 * Subfigures: LaTeX (`subfigure`)
 * Movies: LaTeX (can run separately), just raw embedded HTML in others
 * Floating computer code: LaTeX
 * Fixed computer code: all
 * Floating tables: LaTeX
 * Fixed tables: all
 * Algorithms: LaTeX
 * Margin notes: LaTeX
 * Footnotes: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Bibliography: LaTeX, Sphinx, reStructuredText, MediaWiki
 * Hyperlinks: all (but does not work on paper!)
!epop

!bpop
Conclusion: Highly non-trivial to translate a LaTeX document into something
based on HTML and vice versa.
!epop

!split
======= Concerns I =======

 * Sphinx refers to figures by the caption (has to be short!) and
   strips away any math notation (avoid that!).
 * Sphinx refers to sections by the title, but removes math in the
   reference, so avoid math in headlines.
 * Algorithms must be written up using basic elements like lists or
   paragraphs with headings.
 * Tables cannot be referred to by numbers and have to appear at a
   fixed position in the text.
 * Computer code has to appear at fixed positions in the text.

!split
======= Concerns II =======

 * Footnotes must appear as part of the running text (e.g., sentences
   surrounded by parenthesis), since only a few formats support footnotes.
 * Sphinx does not handle code blocks where the first line is indented.
 * Multiple plots in the same figure: mount the plots to one image
   file and include this (`montage` for png, gif, jpeg; `pdftk`, `pdfnup`,
   and `pdfcrop` for PDF).
 * Keys for items in the bibliography are made visible by Sphinx so
   "bibitems" a la BibTeX must look sensible and consistent.
 * If you need several equations numbered in an `align` environment,
   recall that Sphinx and Markdown cannot handle this.

!split
======= Concerns III =======

 * Index words can appear anywhere in LaTeX, but should be outside
   paragraphs in other tools.
 * References to tables, program code and algorithms can only be
   made in LaTeX.
 * Figures are floating in LaTeX, but fixed in other tools, so place
   figures exactly where they are needed the first time.
 * Curve plots with color lines do not work well in black-and-white
   printing. Make sure plots makes sense in color and BW (e.g., by
   using colors and markers).

!split
======= Solution I: Use a format that translates to many =======

 * Sphinx can do nice HTML, LaTeX, epub, (almost) plain text,
   man pages, Gnome devhelp files, Qt help files, texinfo, JSON
 * Markdown can do LaTeX, HTML, MS Word, OpenOffice, XML,
   reStructuredText, epub, DocBook, ... but not Sphinx
 * IPython notebook: can convert to LaTeX, reStructuredText, HTML, PDF,
   Python script
 * Sphinx and Markdown has some limited math support :-(

!split
======= Solution II: Use Doconce =======

Doconce offers minimalistic typing, great flexibility wrt format,
especially for scientific writing.

 * Can generate LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, Markdown, MediaWiki and other wiki formats
 * Good support for math and code
 * Great flexibility for typesetting code
 * Made for science books *and* smaller teaching modules
 * Support for code snippets from files, embedded movies, warnings/hint/info,
   generalized links
 * Support for HTML5 slides - short way from prose to slides
 * Integrates with preprocessors: preprocess and mako
 * Handles multiple formats for figures
 * Between Mardown and Sphinx wrt tagging (and richness)

!split
======= Doconce: title, authors, date, toc =======

!bc
TITLE: Some Title
AUTHOR: name1 at institution1, with more info, and institution2
AUTHOR: name2 email:name2@web.com at institution
DATE: today

# A table of contents is optional:
TOC: on
!ec

Note: title and authors must have everything on a single line!

!split
======= Doconce: abstract =======

!bc
__Abstract.__
Here goes the abstract...
!ec

Or:
!bc
__Summary.__
Here goes the summary...
!ec


!split
======= Doconce: section headings =======

Headings are marked with =:
!bc
======= This is an H2/section heading =======

===== This is an H3/subsection heading =====

=== This is an H4/paragraph heading ===

__This is a paragraph heading.__
!ec

!split
======= Doconce: markup and lists =======

!bc
 * Bullet lists start with `*`
   and may span several lines
 * *Emphasized words* are possible
 * _Boldface words_ are also possible
 * `inline verbatim code` is featured
!ec

This gets rendered as

 * Bullet lists start with `*`
   and may span several lines
 * *Emphasized words* are possible
 * _Boldface words_ are also possible
 * `inline verbatim code` is featured

!split
======= Doconce: labels, references, index items =======

!bc
# Insert index items in the source
idx{key word1} idx{key word2}

# Label
===== Some section =====
label{this:section}

# Make reference
As we saw in Section ref{this:section}, references, index
items and labels follow a syntax similar to LaTeX
but without backslashes.

# Make reference to equations
See (ref{eq1})-(ref{myeq}).
!ec

!split
======= Doconce: figures and movies =======

Figure with HTML and LaTeX info, and caption, all on one line:

!bc
FIGURE: [figdir/myfig, width=300 frac=1.2] My caption. label{fig1}
!ec
(Will be 300 pixels wide in HTML and span 1.2 times the linewidth
in LaTeX.)

Movies are also supported:

!bc
MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]
!ec
and rendered as

MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]

!split
======= Doconce: math =======

Inline math as in LaTeX:

!bc
...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$.
!ec
gets rendered as ...where $a=\int_{\Omega}fdx$.

An equation environment is surrounded by `!bt` and `!et` tags
(see the source of this document), the rest is plain LaTeX:

!bt
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 u,
label{a:eq}\\
\nabla\cdot\pmb{v} & = 0
label{b:eq}
\end{align}
!et
Limit environments to
!bc
\[ ... \]

\begin{equation*}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

\begin{align*}
\end{align*}

\begin{align}
\end{align}
!ec


!split
======= Doconce: writing code =======

Code is enclosed in `!bc` and `!ec` tags (see the source for this page).

!bc pycod
def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
    """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
    dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
    N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
    T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
    u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
    t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh

    u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
    for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
    return u, t
!ec

!split
======= Doconce: copying code from source files =======

We recommend to copy as much code as possible directly from the
source files:

!bc
@@@CODE file  fromto: start-regex@end-regex

ex:

@@@CODE src/dc_mod.py  fromto: def solver@def verify_three
!ec

 * Computer language can be specified:
   * `!bc pycod` for Python snippet,
   * `!bc pypro` for complete Python program
 * Similar for C (`c`), C++ (`cpp`), Fortran (`f`),
   Matlab (`m`): `!bc mpro`
 * From files: `.py` gives `!bc pycod`, `.f` gives `!bc fcod`, etc.
 * `ptex2tex` can be used to choose between 40+ typesettings of
   computer code in LaTeX
 * `pygments` is used for code typesetting in HTML

!split
======= Doconce: tables =======

!split
======= Doconce: newcommands for math =======

 * `newcommands*.tex` files contain newcommands
 * Used directly in LaTeX
 * Substitution made for many other formats

!split
======= Doconce: exercises =======

Doconce offers a special format for *exercises*, *problems* and *projects*:

!bc

label{demo:ex:1}
files = flip_coin.py, flip_coin.pdf
solutions = mysol.txt, mysol_flip_coin.py

!bsubex
Make a program that simulates flipping a coin $N$ times.

!bhint
Use `r = random.random()` and define head as `r <= 0.5`.
!ehint

!split
======= Doconce: use of preprocessors =======

 * Simple if-else tests a la C preprocessor
 * `FORMAT` variable can be used to test on format
    * if latex/pdflatex do one sort of code (raw LaTeX?)
    * if html, do another type of code, etc.
 * Easy to comment out large portions of text
 * Easy to make different versions of the document
 * The mako preprocessor is really powerful - gives a
   complete programming language inside the document (!)


!split
======= Doconce: slides =======

Very effective way to generate slides from running text:

 * Take a copy of your Doconce prose
 * Strip off as much text as possible
 * Emphasize key points in bullet items
 * Focus on figures and movies
 * Focus on key equations
 * Focus on key code snippets
 * Insert `!split` wherever you want a new slide to
   begin
 * Use 7 `=` or 5 `=` in headings (H2 or H3)
 * Slides are made with HTML5 tools such as reveal.js, deck.js,
   csss, or dzslides

!split
======= Doconce: example on slide code =======

!bc
!split
======= Headline =======

 * Key point 1
 * Key point 2

FIGURE: [figs/myfig, width=800]

MOVIE: [http://www.youtube.com/embed/P8VcZzgdfSc, width=420 height=315]

Key equation:

!bt
\[ -\nabla^2 u = f \quad\hbox{in }\Omega \]
!et

And maybe a final comment?

!split
======= Next slide... =======
!ec



!split
======= Doconce: output in HTML =======

!bc
doconce format html doconcefile

# Solarized HTML style
doconce format html doconcefile --html-solarized

# Control pygments typesetting of code
doconce format html doconcefile --pygments-html-style=native

# Or use plain <pre> tag
doconce format html doconcefile --no-pygments-html

# Further making of slides
doconce slides_html doconcefile reveal --html-slide-theme=darkgray
!ec


!split
======= Doconce: output in pdfLaTeX =======

!bc
doconce format pdflatex doconcefile

# Result: doconcefile.p.tex (ptex2tex file)
# Run either
ptex2tex doconcefile
# or
doconce ptex2tex doconcefile -DHELVETICA envir=minted

pdflatex doconcefile
bibtex doconcefile
pdflatex doconcefile

# More control of how code is typeset
doconce format pdflatex doconcefile --minted-latex-style=trac
doconce ptex2tex doconcefile envir=minted

doconce format pdflatex doconcefile
doconce ptex2tex doconcefile envir=ans:nt

# Autocreate sphinx directory
doconce sphinx_dir theme=pyramid doconcefile
# Copy files and build HTML document
